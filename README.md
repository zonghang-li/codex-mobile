# codex-mobile fork

This fork packages the upstream `codexapp` UI as two commands:

- `codex-mobile` keeps the upstream-compatible behavior, including LAN binding and optional Cloudflare tunneling.
- `codex-mobile-safe` is the recommended command for daily use. It binds to loopback, requires password authentication, uses conservative Codex sandbox defaults, and exposes the service only through an explicit Tailscale Serve command.

## Install from this fork

Node.js 18+ and pnpm are required. Clone the repository so later updates remain an ordinary Git pull:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zonghang-li/codex-mobile.git
cd codex-mobile
pnpm install
pnpm run install:local
```

The installer builds the current checkout and installs both commands under `${HOME}/.local` by default. Ensure `${HOME}/.local/bin` is on `PATH`.

Start the safe command in the foreground:

```bash
codex-mobile-safe start /path/to/project \
  --password-file ~/.codex/codex-mobile-safe-password \
  --no-open
codex-mobile-safe expose tailscale
codex-mobile-safe status
codex-mobile-safe urls
```

For a persistent Linux user service:

```bash
pnpm run service:install
pnpm run service:status
```

The service listens only on `127.0.0.1:5900`. `service:install` creates a mode-`0600` password file when one does not exist, installs the unit, and starts it. Tailscale exposure remains a separate, explicit action:

```bash
codex-mobile-safe expose tailscale
```

If the service should survive logout, enable user lingering once with `loginctl enable-linger "$USER"`.

To update a clone and reinstall the service:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
pnpm install
pnpm run install:local
pnpm run service:restart
```

| Command | Default listener | Remote exposure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `codex-mobile-safe` | `127.0.0.1:5900` | None until `expose tailscale`; never Cloudflare Funnel |
| `codex-mobile` | `0.0.0.0` | Upstream-compatible behavior; may start Cloudflare unless disabled |

Use `codex-mobile-safe doctor` to inspect security invariants. A mobile `RPC thread/resume failed with HTTP 502` normally means the local backend stopped or its reverse proxy cannot reach port 5900. Check `pnpm run service:status` and `journalctl --user -u codex-mobile-safe -n 100` before changing Tailscale configuration.

Agents modifying or operating this fork must read [docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md](docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md).

## Upstream documentation

The remaining README describes upstream `codexapp`. Its `npx codexapp` examples run the published upstream package, not this fork's safe module.

## 🤯 What Is This?
**`codexapp`** is a lightweight bridge that gives you a browser-accessible UI for Codex app-server workflows.

You run one command. It starts a local web server. You open it from your machine, your LAN, or wherever your setup allows.  

**TL;DR 🧠: Codex app UI, unlocked for Linux, Windows, and Termux-powered Android setups.**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start
> **The main event.**

```bash
# 🔓 Run instantly (recommended)
npx codexapp

# 🌐 Then open in browser
# http://localhost:18923
```

By default, `codexapp` now also starts:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<port>
```

It prints the tunnel URL, terminal QR code, and password together in startup output.  
Use `--no-tunnel` to disable this behavior.

If you are using a provider or AI gateway that is already authenticated and do not want `codexapp` to force `codex login` during startup, use:

```bash
npx codexapp --no-login
```

### Linux 🐧
```bash
node -v   # should be 18+
npx codexapp
```

### Windows 🪟 (PowerShell)
```powershell
node -v   # 18+
npx codexapp
```

### Termux (Android) 🤖
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install nodejs -y
npx codexapp
```

Android background requirements:

1. Keep `codexapp` running in the current Termux session (do not close it).
2. In Android settings, disable battery optimization for `Termux`.
3. Keep the persistent Termux notification enabled so Android is less likely to kill it.
4. Optional but recommended in Termux:
```bash
termux-wake-lock
```
5. Open the shown URL in your Android browser. If the app is killed, return to Termux and run `npx codexapp` again.

## iPhone / iPad via Tailscale Serve

If you want to use codexUI from iPhone or iPad Safari, serving it over HTTPS is recommended.

A practical private setup is to run codexUI locally and publish it inside your tailnet with Tailscale Serve:

```powershell
npx codexapp --no-tunnel --port 5900
tailscale serve --bg 5900
```

Then open:

```text
https://<your-machine>.<your-tailnet>.ts.net
```

This setup worked well in practice for:

- iPhone Safari access
- Add to Home Screen
- the built-in dictation / transcription feature in the app
- viewing the same projects and conversations from the Windows host

Notes:

- Tailscale Serve keeps access private to your tailnet
- on iOS, HTTPS / secure context appears to be important for mobile browser access and dictation
- some minor mobile Safari CSS issues may still exist, but they do not prevent normal use
- depending on proxying details, authentication behavior may differ from direct remote access
- if conversations created in the web UI do not immediately appear in the Windows app, restarting the Windows app may refresh them

## ✨ Features
> **The payload.**

- 🚀 One-command launch with `npx codexapp`
- 🌍 Cross-platform support for Linux, Windows, and Termux on Android
- 🖥️ Browser-first Codex UI flow on `http://localhost:18923`
- 🌐 LAN-friendly access from other devices on the same network
- 🧪 Remote/headless-friendly setup for server-based Codex usage
- 🔌 Works with reverse proxies and tunneling setups
- ⚡ No global install required for quick experimentation
- 🎙️ Built-in hold-to-dictate voice input with transcription to composer draft
- 🤖 Optional Telegram bot bridge: send messages to bot, forward into mapped thread, send assistant reply back to Telegram
- 💾 Project portability: export a project as a ZIP from project or thread menus, including matching Codex chat JSONL history under `.codex-project/chats/`
- 📦 Project import: restore exported project ZIPs from the browser via `Import Project`
- 🔁 Imported chats are rewritten for the destination `CODEX_HOME`, project path, and currently selected provider/model so they can be resumed in the new environment
- ⚙️ Project ZIP performance: exports stream ZIP bytes with response backpressure handling and skip generated/git-ignored folders; imports still buffer the selected ZIP once because the browser upload arrives as a single file

### Telegram Bot Bridge (Optional)

Set these environment variables before starting `codexapp`:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<your-telegram-bot-token>"
export TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS="<your-telegram-user-id>,<optional-second-id>"
export TELEGRAM_DEFAULT_CWD="$PWD" # optional, defaults to current working directory
npx codexapp
```

`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is required for safe access. Only allowlisted Telegram user IDs can use the bridge. If no allowed user IDs are configured, incoming Telegram messages are rejected.

To find your Telegram user ID:

1. Send a message to your bot.
2. Run `curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-telegram-bot-token>/getUpdates"`.
3. Read `message.from.id` from the returned update payload.

Bot commands:

- `/start` show quick help and thread picker
- `/threads` list recent threads and pick one
- `/newthread` create and map a new Codex thread for this Telegram chat
- `/thread <threadId>` map current Telegram chat to an existing thread
- `/current` show currently connected thread for this chat
- `/history` show recent history for current thread
- `/status` show bridge/mapping status
- `/whoami` show your Telegram user/chat IDs and authorization state
- `/help` show command reference

Outgoing assistant messages are sent with Telegram `parse_mode=HTML` for formatting, with automatic plain-text fallback if HTML delivery fails.
