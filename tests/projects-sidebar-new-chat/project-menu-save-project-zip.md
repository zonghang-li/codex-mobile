### Feature: Project menu Save project ZIP export

#### Prerequisites / Setup
- Start the app from a checkout with at least one saved local project root.
- Use a project folder containing a small known file, and ensure `.git` and `node_modules` may be present for exclusion checks.
- For chat export/import coverage, use an isolated `CODEX_HOME` containing at least one session JSONL whose `session_meta.payload.cwd` points at the project folder.

#### Actions
1. Open the sidebar project action menu in light theme.
2. Click `Save project`.
3. Confirm the browser receives a `.zip` download for the selected project.
4. Inspect the ZIP contents.
5. Open a thread action menu for a thread inside the same project, click `Save project`, and confirm it downloads the same project ZIP.
6. On the new-thread screen, click `Import Project` next to `Create Project`, choose `Import from ZIP`, choose the downloaded archive, and import it.
7. Click `Import Project` again, choose `Import from folder`, select a local folder in the browser folder picker, and upload it.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-3.

#### Expected Results
- The project menu contains `Save project` between `Browse files` and automation actions.
- Each thread menu contains `Save project` after `Browse files`, exporting that thread's project folder, including projectless chat folders and other local directories.
- Clicking `Save project` downloads a ZIP blob without navigating away from the app.
- The archive includes project files under relative paths.
- `.git`, `node_modules`, and `.DS_Store` entries are not included.
- Existing non-chat files under a project's `.codex-project/` folder round-trip through import; chat JSONL files under `.codex-project/chats/` are handled as imported Codex sessions.
- Matching Codex session JSONL files are included under `.codex-project/chats/`.
- Import creates a new project folder, restores project files, registers the imported project in the sidebar, and writes imported chat sessions into the active `CODEX_HOME` with `cwd` rewritten to the new project folder.
- `Import from folder` opens a browser folder picker, uploads the selected folder through the project import flow, registers the imported copy as the active project, and shows it under Projects even when it has no threads yet.
- Imported chat sessions are rewritten to the destination home's current model and provider so resumed imported threads use the active local configuration.
- The menu item remains readable and aligned in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback / Cleanup
- Delete the downloaded ZIP files from the browser download location.
- Delete the imported project folder and any imported test sessions from the isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
