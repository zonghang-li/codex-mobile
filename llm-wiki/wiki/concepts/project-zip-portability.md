# Project ZIP Portability

Project ZIP portability lets a user move a local project and its matching Codex chat history between Codex homes.

## Export

Project and thread menus expose `Export Project`. The export modal prepares a ZIP containing project files, matching Codex session JSONL files under `.codex-project/chats/`, and matching generated thread titles under `.codex-project/chats/thread-titles.json`, then offers explicit `Download` and `Share` actions. Standard heavyweight/generated metadata such as `.git`, `node_modules`, standard Python virtualenv/cache folders, JS framework caches, Gradle/Rust/.NET outputs, coverage folders, `build`, `dist`, `target`, and OS metadata are excluded by the feature tests. When the export source is inside a Git repo, Git-ignored files are also excluded.

The manifest records portable project metadata such as export time and project name. It does not need the source machine's absolute project path for import.

## Import

The new-thread home screen exposes `Import Project` next to `Create Project`. Clicking it opens the ZIP file picker for an exported project archive.

Imported files are written to a new project folder. Chat JSONL entries under `.codex-project/chats/` are rewritten into the destination `CODEX_HOME` with `cwd` set to the imported project path. Exported title metadata is written into the destination state database and title cache so imported rows keep the original generated titles. Provider/model metadata is rewritten to the current local provider/model so resumed imported threads use the destination configuration.

Project root state is refreshed after import so a newly imported project appears in the sidebar even when it has no threads yet.

## Performance

Project ZIP export streams the archive to the HTTP response instead of building the final ZIP buffer in memory. The stream writer handles response backpressure and client disconnects, and the project walker skips generated folders, dependency directories, build outputs, caches, OS metadata, and Git-ignored files when Git is available.

Chat export scans matching session JSONL files and adds them to `.codex-project/chats/`; project import parses the selected ZIP into memory once because the browser provides the upload as a single file. Imported chat state database writes use bounded staging batches followed by one final atomic transaction that commits the imported rows.

Measured validation for this branch: `pnpm run build` passes, and a fresh `dev2` import of `MiloAgent (4).zip` restored 10 visible imported chat rows in timestamp order on `http://127.0.0.1:5177/`. Full profiler traces were not captured for this local portability flow.

## Boundaries

`.codex-project/chats/` is the reserved namespace for imported Codex sessions. Other `.codex-project/` files round-trip as normal project files.

Project ZIP import and export use matching round-trip limits: at most 10,000 entries and at most 256 MiB for both the archive and logical file data. Export validates those bounds before sending ZIP headers, while import rejects oversized request bodies and archives before creating a destination project. The endpoints still rely on the server's existing authentication and project-path policy rather than a separate saved-root allowlist.

## Docker Validation

Project import/export Docker tests should use the fast reusable test image instead of reinstalling the packed app on every run. Build the base image once from `scripts/docker-fast-test-base.Dockerfile`, then run `scripts/run-docker-fast-test.sh`; the script builds the current repo, mounts it read-only into Docker, reuses a Docker `CODEX_HOME` volume, and starts `node /repo/dist-cli/index.js`.

Use the slower packed-image Docker workflow only when validating package install contents, postinstall behavior, auth/provider startup, or published runtime behavior.
