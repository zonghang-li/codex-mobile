### Feature: Project recency sort, pins, and mobile move mode

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository on `feature/project-recency-sort-upstream`.
- At least two visible projects exist with threads updated at different times.
- Light and dark themes are both available from Settings.

#### Steps
1. Open the sidebar in light theme.
2. Open Projects -> Organize and confirm `Recent projects` is selected by default.
3. Confirm projects appear in descending recent thread activity order.
4. Tap the Projects header reorder icon and confirm move mode starts, all current project thread lists collapse, and drag handles are visible.
5. Drag a non-top project above the first project while still in recent mode.
6. Confirm the moved project appears in the pinned prefix, recent mode remains selected, and project threads do not expand from the drag release.
7. Tap `Done`, open the moved project's menu, choose `Unpin project`, and confirm it returns to its recency-derived position.
8. Switch to `Manual project order`, drag a project, and confirm the manual order sticks independently of recent-mode pins.
9. Enter sidebar search text and confirm project move mode/dragging cannot start while the project list is filtered.
10. Repeat steps 1-9 in dark theme.

#### Expected Results
- Recent mode ignores saved manual `projectOrder` except for explicit pinned project overrides.
- Recent-mode drags pin the moved project without switching the persisted sort mode to manual.
- Recent-mode drag and pin actions update only the pinned project override list and do not rewrite saved manual order.
- Unpinning removes the override and restores the project to recency order.
- Manual project order remains a separate full-list ordering mode.
- Move mode collapses project thread lists, restores prior expansion state on exit, and is blocked while search filters the sidebar.
- Reorder icon, `Done`, drag handles, pin labels, and menus remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Tap `Done` to leave move mode.
- Reset the sidebar Organize menu to the preferred project sort mode.
- Remove any temporary chats or workspace roots created for verification.

### Feature: Thread heartbeat automations

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one local thread exists in the sidebar.
- Local Codex home is writable (`$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`).
- Light and dark themes are both available from Settings.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the sidebar thread menu for a thread without an attached automation.
2. Confirm the menu shows `Add automation…`.
3. Click `Add automation…`.
4. Fill name, prompt, RRULE schedule, and set status to `Paused`.
5. Save the automation and reopen the same thread menu.
6. Confirm the menu now shows `Manage automations…` and the thread row shows an automation chip.
7. Open `Manage automations…`, confirm the saved values are prefilled, then click `Add another automation`.
8. Fill a second automation with a different name and RRULE, save it, and confirm both automations appear in the dialog list.
9. Select each automation from the list and confirm its own prompt, RRULE, and status load independently.
10. Click `Run now` for one saved automation while the thread is idle and confirm the automation run is queued or starts in the selected thread.
11. Start a normal thread turn, reopen `Manage automations…`, click `Run now` for another saved automation, and confirm it waits in the queue until the active turn can finish.
12. Remove one automation and confirm the other remains attached to the same thread.
13. Switch to dark theme, reopen `Manage automations…`, and confirm the list, inputs, textarea, status select, `Run now`, and queued-run notice remain readable.
14. Select a thread that already contains automation runs and confirm both the automation prompt card and the assistant reply are visible.
15. Remove the final automation and confirm the thread menu returns to `Add automation…`.

#### Expected Results
- Multiple thread-scoped heartbeat automations can be created under the Codex automations store with the same `target_thread_id`.
- The automation manager is hosted from the thread menu and supports adding, selecting, editing, and removing individual automations.
- `Run now` enqueues the selected automation immediately using a Codex.app-style heartbeat payload with `automation_id`, `current_time_iso`, and `instructions`, without requiring a schedule tick.
- Automation heartbeat prompts render as visible user-side cards labeled `Sent via automation`; raw heartbeat XML is not shown.
- Manual runs use the existing thread queue, so they do not interrupt an active turn and run in order when the thread is available.
- Removing one automation does not remove other automations attached to the same thread.
- Removing the final automation removes the thread row automation chip and returns the menu to `Add automation…`.
- Light and dark theme automation manager surfaces remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any test automations from the thread automation dialog or delete their folders under `$CODEX_HOME/automations/<automation-id>/`.

### Feature: Project automations and `/automations` panel

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least two sidebar projects have absolute workspace paths.
- Local Codex home is writable (`$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`).
- Light and dark themes are both available from Settings.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open a project overflow menu for a project without an attached automation.
2. Confirm the menu shows `Add automation…`, then create a project automation with a name, prompt, RRULE schedule, and status.
3. Confirm the project row shows an automation chip and the same menu changes to `Manage automations…`.
4. Open `/automations` from the sidebar and confirm the new project automation appears with the visible project display name.
5. Edit the automation from `/automations`, change its name and status, save, and confirm the project row chip count and tooltip update without a full page refresh.
6. Seed or keep a cron automation record whose `cwds` contains two project paths, then edit it from one project and confirm both project rows show the updated name/status.
7. Seed a cron automation record with a TOML-style single-quoted `cwds` array such as `cwds = ['/tmp/project-one', '/tmp/project,two']`, refresh `/automations`, and confirm it is still listed.
8. Inspect `/codex-api/project-automations` for the seeded record and confirm the response includes public automation fields but not `extraTomlLines`.
9. Remove one project that has an attached automation while `/automations` is open and confirm the panel removes the deleted project row after the cleanup completes.
10. Switch to dark theme and repeat opening the project menu and `/automations`; confirm rows, chips, buttons, inputs, and empty states remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- Project-scoped cron automations are listed under every associated `cwd`.
- Editing a multi-`cwd` project automation refreshes all affected sidebar chips/tooltips, not only the currently edited project.
- Existing TOML cron records with valid non-JSON string arrays remain visible and manageable.
- Automation API responses do not include internal preserved TOML metadata such as `extraTomlLines`.
- Removing a project deletes or detaches that project's automation association and refreshes the `/automations` panel.
- Preserved TOML metadata and table sections remain intact after saving or deleting a project automation.
- Light and dark theme project automation surfaces remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any test project automations from the project automation dialog or delete their folders under `$CODEX_HOME/automations/<automation-id>/`.
- Remove temporary test projects or workspace roots created for verification.

### Feature: Projectless new chat folders

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Home directory is writable.
- Light and dark themes are both available from Settings.

#### Steps
1. Open the app in light theme and click the sidebar `New chat` action while an existing thread is selected.
2. Confirm the home composer does not inherit the selected thread folder.
3. Send a first message with a unique prompt such as `Projectless folder smoke test`.
4. Confirm the new thread starts in `~/Documents/Codex/<YYYY-MM-DD>/projectless-folder-smoke-test`.
5. Start another new chat with the same prompt and confirm the folder receives a numeric suffix.
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-3 with a different unique prompt.

#### Expected Results
- `New chat` starts as a projectless chat instead of reusing the current thread cwd.
- Sending the first message creates a real directory under `~/Documents/Codex/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`.
- Folder names are derived from the prompt using lowercase alphanumeric tokens, with suffixes for duplicates.
- Projectless chat rows appear in the `Chats` section and do not create a separate project group from the generated folder name.
- Short projectless prompts such as `hi` remain visible in `Chats` after the thread list refreshes and workspace-root filtering runs.
- If the selected model returns `requires a newer version of Codex`, the turn retries with `gpt-5.4-mini` instead of leaving the new chat failed on 5.5.
- Light and dark theme composer surfaces remain readable and unchanged apart from the folder behavior.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete only the test folders created under `~/Documents/Codex/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`.

## New chat project setup modal

### Feature: Unified create project and GitHub clone modal

Prerequisites/setup:
- Run the app with access to `git` and network access to `github.com`.
- Have a small public GitHub repository URL available for testing.

Steps:
1. Open the app in light theme and navigate to the new chat screen.
2. Confirm the folder actions show `Select folder` and `Create Project`.
3. Click `Create Project` and confirm a modal opens with `New project` and `Clone from GitHub` modes.
4. In `New project`, keep or edit the destination folder, enter a single folder name, and submit.
5. Confirm the created project folder is selected in the new chat folder selector and appears as a project root.
6. Reopen the modal, switch to `Clone from GitHub`, paste a valid `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` URL, and submit.
7. Confirm the cloned repository folder is selected in the new chat folder selector and appears as a project root.
8. Switch the app to dark theme and repeat opening the modal.
9. Confirm the modal, tabs, inputs, error message, and buttons have readable contrast and stable spacing.

Expected results:
- New project creation and GitHub cloning share one modal and destination folder field.
- Created and cloned folders are registered as project roots and selected for the new chat.
- After cloning, the folder selector immediately includes the cloned project without a full page refresh.
- Invalid project names or non-GitHub URLs show an inline modal error without changing the selected folder.
- A stalled clone eventually fails with an error instead of keeping the request open indefinitely.
- Light and dark themes render the unified modal consistently with the existing new-chat controls.

Rollback/cleanup:
- Remove the created project folder from the filesystem if it was only used for testing.
- Remove the cloned repository folder from the filesystem if it was only used for testing.
- Remove the test projects from the app project list if they are no longer needed.

### Feature: Empty project new thread action

#### Steps
1. Open the app in light theme.
2. Find the empty project row in the sidebar that shows `No threads`.
3. Click that project's new thread icon.
4. Confirm the home composer opens and the folder dropdown is set to the empty project's workspace root.
5. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2-4.

#### Expected Results
- The new thread icon works for projects with zero threads.
- The new thread screen uses the clicked project's registered workspace root instead of leaving the folder blank or reusing another project.
- Light and dark theme sidebar and composer surfaces remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup is required unless a test message is sent; delete that test thread if created.

### Feature: Start new thread header Git branch dropdown

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- At least one Git-backed workspace folder is available in the Start new thread folder dropdown.
- Light and dark themes are both available from Settings.

#### Steps
1. Open the app in light theme.
2. Click the sidebar or header new thread icon to open Start new thread.
3. Select a Git-backed folder.
4. Confirm the header actions next to the terminal control show the Git checkout branch dropdown.
5. Open the branch dropdown and confirm branch search/options are available.
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2-5.

#### Expected Results
- Start new thread shows the same header Git checkout dropdown used by existing thread pages when the selected folder is a Git repository.
- Switching the selected folder updates the dropdown branch state for that folder.
- Non-Git folders do not show the Git checkout dropdown.
- Light and dark theme header controls remain readable and aligned.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- If a branch was switched during testing, switch back to the original branch before continuing.

### Feature: Telegram bot token stored in dedicated global file

#### Prerequisites

### Feature: Telegram chatIds persisted for bot DM sending

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Telegram bot already configured in the app.
- Access to `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

#### Steps
1. Send `/start` to the Telegram bot from your DM.
2. Wait for the app to process the update, then open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.
3. Confirm `chatIds` contains your DM chat id as the first element.
4. In the app, reconnect Telegram bot with the same token.
5. Re-open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` and confirm `chatIds` remains present.

#### Expected Results
- `chatIds` is written after Telegram DM activity.
- `chatIds` persists across bot reconfiguration.
- `botToken`, `chatIds`, and `allowedUserIds` are all present in `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

3. Repeat with triple-asterisk wrapping: `***https://anyclaw.store/claim/a7m2z7***` and `***[claim link](https://anyclaw.store/claim/a7m2z7)***`.
4. Confirm the rendered row contains one clickable `a.message-file-link` for the URL.
5. Confirm no literal `**`, `***`, or stray `*` characters appear before or after the link.
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2 through 5.

#### Expected Results
- Bold-wrapped and triple-asterisk-wrapped bare URLs and Markdown links render as clickable links without visible Markdown emphasis markers.
- Existing URL/file-link href, title, and visible link text behavior is unchanged.
- Link color and contrast remain usable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the parser change in `src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue` if bold-wrapped links need to show raw Markdown markers again.

### Qodo feedback diagnostics reliability fixes

#### Feature/Change Name
Feedback diagnostics startup hardening, project automation delete failure handling, and coalesced composer overflow measurement.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. At least one sidebar project with a configured project automation
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, temporarily make `DELETE /codex-api/project-automation` fail, for example by stopping the local API bridge or forcing a 500 response in a development proxy.
2. Open the project menu for a project with an automation and click Remove.
3. Confirm the sidebar does not trigger an unhandled promise rejection and shows a small project automation error message.
4. Restore the API bridge and refresh project automations.
5. Confirm the automation chip/server state is reloaded instead of staying optimistically removed.
6. Open the app in an environment where `window.fetch` is missing or read-only and confirm the app still mounts.
7. Trigger a chat send failure and click Send feedback next to the chat error.
8. Confirm Chrome or the OS opens the configured `mailto:` handler with `brutalstrikedevs@gmail.com`, diagnostics, bounded visible page text, and summarized browser/app state prefilled.
9. Type a long draft in the composer and confirm the expand control still appears when the textarea overflows.
10. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2-9.

#### Expected Results
- Project automation delete failures are caught, recorded in feedback diagnostics, and surfaced as a visible sidebar error.
- Automation state is restored or reloaded after a failed delete.
- Feedback diagnostics never prevent app startup when fetch cannot be patched.
- Chat and Skills Hub error feedback links use native `mailto:` anchor handling so Chrome can open the configured email handler, while static link `href` values stay minimal until click.
- Feedback email bodies include bounded visible page text alongside diagnostics.
- Feedback email bodies include localStorage/sessionStorage state, route/hash, online state, language, and platform, with sensitive-looking storage values omitted and oversized values summarized.
- Composer overflow checks remain functional without scheduling duplicate same-tick measurements.
- The sidebar error message remains readable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore any temporary API failure/proxy change.

### Composer expands long drafts to full screen

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread composer full-screen expand control for multi-line drafts.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. Any existing thread is open and send controls are enabled
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, type or paste at least six lines into the composer.
2. Confirm the expand button appears in the composer input area.
3. Click the expand button.
4. Confirm the composer fills the viewport, keeps the draft text, and leaves model/skill/thinking/send controls usable at the bottom.
5. Click the collapse button.
6. Confirm the composer returns to its normal inline size with the draft still intact.
7. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-6.

#### Expected Results
- Short drafts do not show the expand control.
- Long or overflowing drafts show an icon-only expand control.
- Full-screen mode uses the same draft state and submit controls as inline mode.
- Full-screen and inline states are readable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear the draft from the composer.

---

### Error-triggered feedback button

#### Feature/Change Name
Feedback action appears in Settings and on visible error banners after captured UI/runtime/API failures, then opens prefilled email diagnostics.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173` or an alternate free port).
2. Browser devtools available to inject a test error or failed fetch.
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, load the home screen, open Settings, and confirm no `Send feedback` row is visible during a clean state.
2. Trigger a failure, for example run `fetch('/codex-api/rpc', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: '{}' })` in the browser console or open a folder path that produces a visible load error.
3. Reopen Settings and confirm a `Send feedback` row with `Issue detected` appears after the failed request is recorded.
4. Trigger or view a visible error banner, such as the missing Codex CLI composer banner, a chat send/connection error in the live conversation overlay, a settings provider error, a folder picker error, a Skills Hub error, or a branch dropdown error, and confirm that error state includes a compact `Send feedback` action.
5. Confirm no feedback action appears in the content header during normal use.
6. Click `Send feedback` and confirm the mail client opens a draft to `brutalstrikedevs@gmail.com`.
7. Confirm the draft body includes current URL, user agent, viewport, app/worktree version info, and recent diagnostics including the failed request or visible error.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-7.

#### Expected Results
- The settings feedback action is absent during normal operation.
- Runtime errors, unhandled rejections, failed fetches/API responses, and visible load failures make the Settings feedback action visible.
- Visible error states, including chat send/connection failures, include a local `Send feedback` action so the user can report the error from the same context.
- The generated `mailto:` draft is prefilled with useful diagnostics and does not submit anything automatically.
- No feedback action is shown in the app header during normal use.
- The Settings feedback row and visible-error feedback actions remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Close the generated email draft without sending if this was only a test.

---

### Missing Codex CLI chat error

#### Feature/Change Name
Fresh installs without a runnable Codex CLI show a visible chat runtime error.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Start the app in an isolated environment without `codex` in `PATH` and without `CODEXUI_CODEX_COMMAND`.
2. Use a mobile viewport such as `390x844`.
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher when the app can reach settings.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the app home/new chat screen.
2. Confirm the composer area shows `Codex CLI not found. Install @openai/codex or set CODEXUI_CODEX_COMMAND.`
3. Confirm the model dropdown no longer fails silently as the only visible symptom.
4. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-3.

#### Expected Results
- The missing CLI condition is visible in the chat/composer area.
- The banner remains readable and does not overlap the mobile composer controls.
- Dark theme uses a dark error surface, not a light-theme panel.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop and remove the isolated container or test server.

### Composio logged-out connector preview

#### Feature/Change Name
Logged-out Composio tab shows a promotional connector preview with example integrations and clear login/dashboard actions.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. Composio CLI installed
3. Composio CLI logged out (`~/.composio/composio logout`)
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the Directory page and switch to the Composio tab.
2. Confirm the logged-out state shows the connector catalog preview hero instead of a plain empty message.
3. Confirm example connector cards are visible for Gmail, Google Calendar, Reddit, YouTube, Google Drive, and X.
4. Type `reddit` in the Composio search box and confirm the preview cards filter to matching example content.
5. Confirm `Login to Composio` starts the CLI login flow and `Open dashboard` opens the Composio dashboard URL.
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-4.

#### Expected Results
- Logged-out users see a richer preview of likely Composio connector value without requiring live catalog data.
- The preview does not claim the example cards are connected; cards are labeled `Preview`.
- Search filters the preview cards while logged out.
- Login and dashboard actions remain available.
- The hero, cards, text, badges, and buttons remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Re-login to Composio if needed with `~/.composio/composio login --no-browser -y`.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. More than 50 total unarchived threads exist
3. At least one older thread outside the initial recent page is pinned
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, reload the app.
2. Immediately open the sidebar Pinned section.
3. Confirm pinned rows from older history remain in the Pinned section after the initial thread list appears.
4. Wait for background thread pagination to finish.
5. Confirm the same pinned rows remain visible and can still be selected.
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-5.

#### Expected Results
- Saved pinned thread IDs are preserved while only the initial thread-list page is loaded.
- Missing pinned IDs are pruned only after the full thread list has loaded.
- Pinned rows remain readable and selectable in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Unpin any disposable threads created only for this test.

### Startup avoids duplicate setup probes

#### Feature/Change Name
Startup loads Git repository status only for the active thread/new-thread cwd or an opened project menu, shares workspace-root state reads, and returns free-mode status without waiting on OpenRouter model discovery.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. Browser runtime profiler available (`pnpm run profile:browser`)
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, run `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 pnpm run profile:browser`.
2. Inspect the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*.json`.
3. Confirm startup does not call `/codex-api/git/repository-status` once per visible project.
4. Confirm startup performs at most one `/codex-api/workspace-roots-state` GET before user actions.
5. Confirm `/codex-api/free-mode/status` completes without waiting for a live `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` request.
6. Open a thread and confirm at most the selected thread cwd is checked with `/codex-api/git/repository-status`.
7. Open the project action menu for several projects and confirm Git-backed actions still appear only for Git repositories after each menu-specific status check.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-7.

#### Expected Results
- Initial sidebar Git status hydration does not scan every visible project.
- The `/codex-api/git/repository-status/batch` endpoint is not used.
- Git status checks are lazy and scoped to the active thread/new-thread cwd or the project menu being opened.
- App startup and initial thread loading share workspace-root state loading instead of issuing duplicate startup reads.
- Free-mode status returns cached or fallback model options immediately and refreshes model discovery in the background.
- Git-backed project menu actions remain correct in light theme and dark theme.
- Free-mode controls remain readable and functional in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*` artifacts if they are not needed for comparison evidence.

### Revert PR 131 project recency and mobile move mode

#### Feature/Change Name
PR #131 revert: remove project recency ordering and mobile project move mode while preserving later sidebar actions.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Sidebar has at least two projects and projectless chats
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the sidebar Projects section.
2. Open the Projects organize menu.
3. Confirm the menu still exposes thread organization and chat sort controls, but does not expose project recency/manual sort controls.
4. Open a project action menu and confirm browse, rename, remove, worktree, and git status actions still behave normally.
5. On a mobile-sized viewport, confirm there is no project move mode affordance or drag handle from PR #131.
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-5.

#### Expected Results
- Project recency/manual sort controls from PR #131 are absent.
- Project pinning/move mode controls from PR #131 are absent.
- Existing sidebar project actions and git-status menu behavior remain available.
- Sidebar rows, menus, and actions remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Qodo review fixes for PR 130 and PR 131 reverts

#### Feature/Change Name
Fix review regressions from reverting PR #130 and PR #131.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Sidebar has multiple projects, including duplicate folder leaf names when available
3. Sidebar has at least one projectless chat
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, search the sidebar so the project list is filtered.
2. Try to drag a project row while search is active.
3. Confirm no project drag or reorder starts during the filtered search view.
4. Clear search and drag a project row, then release it and confirm the follow-up click does not collapse or expand the dragged project unexpectedly.
5. Open a project menu near the bottom of the scrollable sidebar and confirm the menu opens upward only when needed and stays within the visible sidebar boundary.
6. Open or create a project whose folder leaf name collides with another root and confirm the intended full-path-disambiguated project moves to the top.
7. Confirm projectless chats with empty cwd remain visible when workspace roots are configured.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-7.

#### Expected Results
- Project dragging is disabled during sidebar search.
- Drag completion does not trigger an accidental project collapse or expansion.
- Project menu direction uses the rendered menu height and avoids viewport/sidebar overflow.
- Duplicate folder leaf names use the disambiguated project order name.
- Empty-cwd projectless chats remain visible.
- Sidebar rows, menus, and drag states remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Composer mode scoping and Fast mode support

#### Feature/Change Name
Plan mode is scoped to the current chat instead of becoming the default for every chat, and Fast mode is available for supported GPT 5.4 and GPT 5.5 model IDs.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. At least two existing threads are available
3. Model list includes `gpt-5.4` or a `gpt-5.4-*` variant and `gpt-5.5` or a `gpt-5.5-*` variant
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open thread A, open the composer add menu, and enable Plan mode.
2. Open thread B and confirm Plan mode is off by default.
3. Return to thread A and confirm Plan mode remains on for that thread.
4. Open Start new thread, enable Plan mode, send a first message, and confirm the created thread starts in Plan mode.
5. Return to Start new thread again and confirm Plan mode is off for the next new chat.
6. Select `gpt-5.4` or a `gpt-5.4-*` model and confirm the Fast mode switch is visible.
7. Select `gpt-5.5` or a `gpt-5.5-*` model and confirm the Fast mode switch is visible.
8. Select an unsupported model family and confirm the Fast mode switch is hidden.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-8.

#### Expected Results
- Enabling Plan mode in one existing thread does not enable it in other existing threads.
- A new-chat Plan mode selection applies to the created chat but does not persist as the default for later new chats.
- Fast mode is visible for GPT 5.4 and GPT 5.5 model IDs, including dashed variants.
- Fast mode remains hidden for unsupported model families.
- Composer controls and menus remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Turn Plan mode off in any test threads if desired.

### Lazy project Git status checks

#### Feature/Change Name
Project Git repository status is loaded lazily from project menus instead of scanning every visible project during startup.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. Sidebar contains multiple projects, including at least one Git-backed project and one non-Git project
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, load the home route and confirm the Projects section renders normally.
2. Open browser devtools or runtime profile output and confirm startup does not issue one `/codex-api/git/repository-status` request per visible project.
3. Open the action menu for a Git-backed project.
4. Confirm the menu remains readable and the `New worktree` item appears after the Git status check completes.
5. Right-click the header row for the same Git-backed project.
6. Confirm the context menu remains readable and the `New worktree` item appears after the Git status check completes.
7. Open the action menu for a non-Git project.
8. Confirm the menu remains readable and `New worktree` is not shown.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 3 through 8.

#### Expected Results
- Startup avoids eager Git status scans for all project rows.
- Opening a project menu through click or right-click still loads that project's Git status on demand.
- Menus re-measure placement after async Git status updates add the `New worktree` row.
- `New worktree` remains available for Git-backed projects and hidden for non-Git projects.
- Project menus remain usable and visually consistent in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Thread archive recovery and sidebar pruning

#### Feature/Change Name
Deleting a thread recovers from Codex `no rollout found` archive failures and removes successfully archived threads from the sidebar immediately.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Codex CLI available on `PATH`
3. At least one normal thread and one newly-created thread that has not yet produced a rollout
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, create a new empty thread from the sidebar.
2. Open that thread's menu and choose `Delete thread`.
3. Confirm the thread disappears from the sidebar without a `no rollout found` error.
4. Rename another visible thread, then delete it.
5. Confirm the renamed thread disappears immediately and does not reappear after sidebar refresh/background pagination.
6. Call `thread/list` with `archived:false` through `/codex-api/rpc` and confirm the deleted thread ids are absent.
7. Call `thread/list` with `archived:true` and confirm the deleted thread ids are present.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-5.

#### Expected Results
- Empty or not-yet-materialized threads are archived after CodexUI sets a fallback name and retries.
- Already archived threads are treated as archived instead of surfacing a stale `no rollout found` error.
- The sidebar prunes archived ids from its accumulated paginated list before refreshing.
- Older unarchived threads may appear as the list refills, but archived threads do not remain visible.
- Behavior is consistent in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.
### Unread thread cutoff state

#### Feature/Change Name
Unread thread state uses a local cutoff timestamp so existing threads are not all marked unread after first load.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`).
2. Browser localStorage is available for the app origin.
3. At least two existing threads are present.
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher.

#### Steps
1. Clear only `codex-web-local.thread-unread-cutoff.v1` from localStorage for the app origin.
2. Load the app in light theme.
3. Confirm existing threads are not all marked unread on first load.
4. Create or receive an update in a different thread after the app has loaded.
5. Confirm that updated thread can show unread when it is not selected or in progress.
6. Create or receive an update in a second unselected thread.
7. Open the first updated thread and confirm only that thread's unread indicator clears.
8. Confirm the second updated thread remains unread until it is opened.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 4 through 8.

#### Expected Results
- Missing cutoff state initializes to the current time instead of treating every thread as unread.
- Threads updated after the cutoff can still become unread.
- Opening a thread updates only that thread's read state and clears only that thread's unread indicator.
- Unread indicators remain readable in both light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any disposable test threads created for this validation.

### CLI password output redaction

#### Feature/Change Name
CLI startup output no longer prints the configured password or embeds it in the tunnel URL.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Project dependencies are installed.
2. CLI build is available from the current branch.

#### Steps
1. Run `pnpm run build:cli`.
2. Start the CLI with a disposable password: `node dist-cli/index.js --no-tunnel --no-open --port 5998 --password TEST_SECRET_SHOULD_NOT_PRINT`.
3. Confirm startup output includes the local and network URLs.
4. Confirm startup output does not include `Password:` or `TEST_SECRET_SHOULD_NOT_PRINT`.
5. Start the CLI without an explicit password and confirm startup output prints `Generated password file:` with a path under `$CODEX_HOME`.
6. Confirm the generated password file exists, is readable by the current user, and has `0600` permissions.
7. If tunnel testing is available, start with tunnel enabled and confirm the printed tunnel URL and QR code do not include `/password=`.

#### Expected Results
- Password-protected startup still works.
- The password is not printed as a standalone line.
- Auto-generated passwords remain discoverable through the generated password file path.
- Tunnel output does not include an autologin URL containing the password.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the disposable CLI process.

### Composer skill chip opens SKILL.md

#### Feature/Change Name
Selected skill labels in the thread composer open that skill's `SKILL.md` in the web file browser.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. At least one installed skill is available in the composer skill picker
3. Browser pop-ups from the local dev origin are allowed
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open any thread with the composer enabled.
2. Open the `Skills` picker and select an installed skill.
3. Confirm the selected skill appears as a green chip above the input field.
4. Click the skill name on the green chip.
5. Confirm a new tab opens to `/codex-local-browse.../SKILL.md` for that skill.
6. Return to the composer and click the chip `x`.
7. Confirm the skill is removed and no file-browser tab is opened by the remove action.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2 through 7.

#### Expected Results
- The skill chip label is clickable and opens the selected skill's `SKILL.md` in the web file browser.
- Skill paths that point at a skill directory are normalized to the nested `SKILL.md` file.
- The remove button still only removes the skill from the composer.
- The chip and focus/hover states remain readable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Close any file-browser tabs opened during validation.

### npx run dev compatibility shim

#### Feature/Change Name
The accidental `npx run dev` command starts the repository dev wrapper instead of failing with a missing `dev` module.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Run from the repository root.
2. Local dependencies are available, or the dev wrapper can install them with `pnpm install`.
3. Port 5173 is free, or Vite can select the next available port.

#### Steps
1. Run `npx run dev`.
2. Confirm the command reaches the existing `scripts/dev.cjs` wrapper and starts Vite.
3. Stop the dev server with Ctrl-C.
4. Repeat with `npx run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.

#### Expected Results
- `npx run dev` no longer fails with `Cannot find module '<repo>/dev'`.
- The command starts the same dev server path as `npm run dev` / `pnpm run dev`.
- Host and port arguments are passed through to Vite.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop any dev server process started for validation.

### Selected skills visible on sent chat messages

#### Feature/Change Name
Selected composer skills are shown as skill chips on the user message after send/history load.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. At least one installed skill is available in the composer `Skills` dropdown
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open an existing thread or start a new thread.
2. Open the composer `Skills` dropdown and select one skill.
3. Type and send a short message.
4. Confirm the sent user message shows a `Skill` chip with the selected skill name.
5. Click the skill chip and confirm the current browser tab opens the skill `SKILL.md` file through the local browse view.
6. Refresh or reopen the thread and confirm the same skill chip remains visible and clickable in history.
7. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2-6 with another message.

#### Expected Results
- Selected skills are visible on the user message, not only in the composer before send.
- Skill chips show the skill name and expose the skill path in the tooltip.
- Skill chips link to the selected skill file using the local browse route in the current tab.
- Skill chips remain visible after thread history reload.
- Skill chips are readable in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove disposable test messages/threads if needed.

### Session skill recovery cache and multi-message placement

#### Feature/Change Name
Recovered selected-skill metadata is cached per session log and attached to the latest user message in the turn.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. At least one installed skill is available in the composer `Skills` dropdown
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open an existing thread or start a new thread.
2. Select one skill from the composer `Skills` dropdown.
3. Type and send a short message.
4. Refresh or reopen the same thread twice.
5. Confirm the sent user message still shows one skill chip and does not accumulate duplicate chips.
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2-5 with another message.
7. Run `pnpm vitest run src/server/codexAppServerBridge.inlinePayload.test.ts`.

#### Expected Results
- Skill metadata recovered from session JSONL remains visible after repeated history loads.
- Repeated loads reuse the unchanged session recovery parse instead of reparsing the same log for every turn-bearing RPC.
- In turns with multiple user-message items, recovered skill chips are attached to the latest user message in that turn.
- Skill chips remain readable in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove disposable test messages/threads if needed.

### Skills sync idempotent commits and nested shared skills handling

#### Feature/Change Name
Skills Sync skips unchanged manifest writes and does not fail parent commits when only nested `shared_skills` content is dirty.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173`)
2. GitHub Skills Sync is connected to a private skills sync repo
3. `/Users/igor/.codex/skills/shared_skills` exists as a nested Git repository
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `#/skills`.
2. Click `Startup Sync` when no installed skills manifest content has changed.
3. Confirm the sync completes without adding a new `Update synced skills manifest` commit to the GitHub repo.
4. Modify a file inside `/Users/igor/.codex/skills/shared_skills` without committing it inside that nested repository.
5. Click `Push` or `Startup Sync` again.
6. Confirm the sync does not show `Command failed (git commit -m Sync installed skills folder and manifest)` for the parent `/Users/igor/.codex/skills` repository.
7. Confirm the startup auto-push path skips when the only local status is dirty nested `shared_skills` content and local `HEAD` equals `origin/main`.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1, 2, and 5.

#### Expected Results
- Unchanged `installed-skills.json` content is not written back to GitHub, so repeated empty-looking manifest commits are not created.
- A dirty nested `shared_skills` repository does not make the parent skills sync fail with `no changes added to commit`.
- Dirty nested `shared_skills` content alone does not keep triggering no-op startup push work.
- Skills Sync status, errors, and action buttons remain readable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert or commit the intentional test edit inside `/Users/igor/.codex/skills/shared_skills`.

### Header Git branch dropdown with commit reset

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread header Git dropdown replaces the simple review action with a commits/branches picker, Review access, safe branch switching, selected-commit file details, branch reset-to-commit, and reset-history commit preservation.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open a thread whose `cwd` is inside a Git repository with at least two branches and several commits
3. Use a disposable local branch with at least two commits ahead of its reset target.
4. Ensure the repository has no tracked uncommitted changes for successful branch switch/reset paths: `git -C <thread-cwd> status --porcelain`
5. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the Git dropdown in the thread header.
2. Confirm the trigger shows the current branch, or the detached commit subject if the repository is already detached.
3. Confirm the menu initially shows only commits on the left and branches on the right, with no commit-files panel before a commit is selected.
4. Confirm the left column defaults to the current branch and shows no more than 50 recent commits with short SHA, subject, and date.
5. Confirm the open dropdown visually layers above the sidebar and above the Review pane if the pane is already open.
6. Confirm the top action is styled as a button, reads `Review Worktree Changes`, and shows `+`/`-` line counts; click it and confirm the dropdown stays open while the review pane opens above it directly to changes without showing a `Findings` tab or `Run review` button; click the Review pane `X` and confirm only the pane closes while the dropdown stays open; click `Review Worktree Changes` again and confirm the pane toggles open.
7. Type part of a commit subject or short SHA in the left commit search and confirm the commit list filters.
8. Turn off `Reset-history refs` and confirm the commit list reloads without saved reset-history refs.
9. Turn `Reset-history refs` back on and confirm saved reset-history commits reappear when available.
10. Toggle `Reset-history refs` while the commit list is still loading and confirm the list reloads for the new toggle state instead of staying on the previous result.
11. Type part of a branch name in search and confirm the branch list filters.
12. Click a different branch row and confirm the left commit list changes to that branch without immediately switching checkout.
13. Use the branch row `Checkout` action with a clean worktree and confirm the header updates to that branch.
14. Confirm local branches appear first and remote branches appear at the end of the branch list.
15. Select a remote branch row and confirm it can load commits but does not show a `Checkout` action.
16. Select an older commit on the disposable local branch and confirm the dropdown widens and shows a left-side file panel with that commit subject, file changes, per-file `+`/`-` line counts, and a `Reset` button without changing HEAD.
17. Click a commit ref badge and confirm the full commit SHA is copied to the clipboard without changing the selected commit.
18. Click a file in the selected commit details and confirm the dropdown closes, clears the selected commit state for the next open, and the Review pane opens in commit mode with that file selected without auto-centering the first hunk; if the Review pane previously used base-branch comparison, confirm the commit review meta row shows the commit SHA and does not show `vs <base-branch>`.
19. Click `Reset` for the selected commit and confirm the header stays on that branch instead of entering detached HEAD.
20. Confirm `git -C <thread-cwd> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` still prints the branch name and `git -C <thread-cwd> rev-parse --short HEAD` matches the selected commit.
21. Reopen/select the same branch and confirm commits that were ahead of the reset target still appear, with the selected branch HEAD marked `current`.
22. Repeat reset on the same branch several times and confirm the dropdown still opens quickly and shows recent reset-history commits.
23. Create a tracked uncommitted change, try to switch branch or reset to a commit, and confirm the dropdown shows a dirty-worktree error instead of switching or resetting.
24. Create only an untracked file whose path includes leading/trailing whitespace and does not exist in the target commit, try to reset to a commit, and confirm the reset proceeds while the exact untracked filename remains in place.
25. Create only an untracked file whose path includes leading/trailing whitespace and exists in the target commit, try to reset to that target, and confirm the reset proceeds and the exact untracked filename is moved under `.codex/untracked-backups/` instead of being overwritten or renamed incorrectly.
26. Add or inspect a commit that changes a file whose name includes leading/trailing whitespace, then select that commit and confirm the commit file list shows the exact path, correct `+`/`-` counts, and opens the same path in the Review pane.
27. Create an untracked nested file whose parent path is a tracked file in the target commit, or the inverse file/directory case, and confirm checkout/reset moves the conflicting untracked path to `.codex/untracked-backups/` before the Git operation.
28. Force a checkout/reset failure after an untracked backup move, such as by making the target branch unavailable in a disposable repository, and confirm the moved untracked file is restored to its original path.
29. Open a commit file in the Review pane, navigate to a different thread or repository cwd, and confirm the commit-scoped file/sha state clears and the pane closes instead of showing the old commit against the new repo.
30. At a mobile viewport around 375px wide, select a commit and confirm the dropdown fits inside the viewport with branches first, commits second, and selected-commit files last, stacked vertically instead of squeezed into columns.
31. Narrow the Review pane file list and confirm changed-file rows do not inherit folder-depth indentation, long names truncate on one line instead of wrapping vertically, and the `+`/`-` counts remain visible.
32. At a mobile viewport around 375px wide, open the Review pane, scroll the diff content vertically, and confirm the `X` close button remains visible and tappable in the top-right corner.
33. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.

#### Preserved Prior Coverage
1. Click `Review Worktree Changes` and confirm the review pane opens; click it again and confirm the pane toggles.
2. Type part of a branch name in search and confirm the branch list filters.
3. Select a different branch with a clean worktree using the checkout action and confirm the header updates to that branch.
4. Select a branch row and confirm recent commits load with short SHA, subject, and date.
5. Confirm remote branch rows are inspectable, appear after local branches, and do not trigger local reset without a supported local branch action.
6. Select an older commit on the disposable local branch and confirm the header stays on that branch instead of entering detached HEAD.
7. Confirm `git -C <thread-cwd> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` still prints the branch name and `git -C <thread-cwd> rev-parse --short HEAD` matches the selected commit after reset.
8. Reopen/select the same branch and confirm commits that were ahead of the reset target still appear, with the selected branch HEAD marked `current`.
9. Repeat reset on the same branch several times and confirm the dropdown still opens quickly and shows recent reset-history commits.
10. Create a tracked uncommitted change, try to switch branch or reset to a commit, and confirm the dropdown shows a dirty-worktree error instead of switching or resetting.
11. Create only an untracked file, try to reset to a commit, and confirm the reset proceeds while preserving the untracked file in place or moving it to `.codex/untracked-backups/` if the target would overwrite it.
12. Switch to dark theme and repeat the branch filtering, commit loading, reset-history, dirty-worktree, and untracked-file checks.

#### Expected Results
- The header dropdown exposes Review, current checkout state, a left-side commit list, and a right-side searchable branch list before a commit is selected.
- The selected-commit file panel is hidden until commit selection, then appears on the left and expands the dropdown width.
- Each selected-commit file row shows added and removed line counts, using `-` for binary or unavailable counts.
- The dropdown layer is viewport-positioned and appears above the sidebar when open.
- The Review pane renders above the open dropdown and app chrome.
- Clicking the dropdown `Review Worktree Changes` button keeps the dropdown open while toggling the Review pane.
- Clicking the Review pane `X` while the dropdown is open closes only the Review pane and leaves the dropdown open.
- The `Review Worktree Changes` button shows current worktree added and removed line counts.
- The Review pane toolbar keeps `Refresh` but does not show a `Findings` tab or `Run review` button.
- The current branch commit list loads by default and is capped at 50 commits.
- The commit list can be searched by SHA, subject, or date without changing the selected branch.
- Reset-history refs can be shown or hidden from the commit list without changing the selected branch.
- Reset-history toggles are keyed by both branch and reset-history state, so an in-flight load for one state does not suppress loading the other state.
- Branch switching and branch reset-to-commit are blocked by tracked uncommitted changes, but untracked-only changes are preserved and allowed.
- Commit selection opens file details without resetting or detaching HEAD.
- Commit ref badges copy the full SHA to the clipboard without triggering commit selection.
- Commit file names and untracked file names with leading/trailing whitespace are parsed from NUL-delimited Git output and are not trimmed before display, counting, backup, or Review-pane navigation.
- The selected commit `Reset` button resets the local branch to that commit instead of detaching HEAD.
- Remote branches are inspectable but cannot be checked out directly from this control.
- Clicking a selected commit file opens the Review pane against that commit diff and selects that path without auto-centering the selected hunk.
- Commit review mode shows the selected commit SHA in the Review pane meta row and never shows a base-branch comparison label.
- Clicking a selected commit file clears the dropdown commit selection before closing, so reopening starts without the stale file panel.
- Changed-file rows in the Review pane file list do not inherit folder-depth indentation, so long names have enough room to truncate horizontally instead of wrapping one character per line when the list is narrow.
- Remote branches appear after local branches in the branch list.
- Prior branch-search, inline-commit, remote-branch inspection, reset-to-commit, dirty-worktree, and untracked-file manual coverage remains represented in the section.
- The branch commit list still shows commits that were ahead of the reset target by reading saved internal reset-history refs.
- Reset-history refs are bounded so repeated resets do not grow commit-list inputs without limit.
- Untracked files that would collide with target tracked files are moved to `.codex/untracked-backups/` before checkout/reset, preserving exact Git path bytes from NUL-delimited output.
- Untracked file/directory conflicts are detected when either the untracked path or target path is the other's directory prefix.
- If checkout/reset fails after moving untracked files into `.codex/untracked-backups/`, those files are restored to their original paths.
- Commit-scoped Review pane state is cleared when navigating to another thread or repository cwd.
- The selected branch HEAD commit is marked `current` in the commit list.
- The mobile Review pane keeps its close button visible above the app chrome in both light theme and dark theme.
- The mobile Review pane diff area scrolls vertically without moving or hiding the pane header.
- The Review pane overlay, toolbar, file list, file sheet, and diff surfaces use dark backgrounds and borders in dark theme instead of showing light surfaces.
- On mobile, branches, commits, and selected-commit file details stack vertically in that order and stay inside the viewport in both light theme and dark theme.
- Loading and error messages remain visible in the dropdown without using browser alerts.
- Dropdown surfaces, text, badges, and errors are readable in both light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch back to the original branch used before the test.
- Reset or delete the disposable local branch used for commit reset validation.
- Revert or discard the tracked dirty-worktree file created for the blocked-switch validation.
- Delete any untracked files created for untracked preservation validation.
- Delete any tracked test commits/files created for whitespace-path commit-list validation.
- Inspect and remove test-only files under `.codex/untracked-backups/` after confirming backup behavior.
- Clear any copied commit SHA from the clipboard if the test environment requires clipboard cleanup.

#### Performance Audit Evidence
- `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 pnpm run profile:browser` completed after the review-summary changes.
- Latest report: `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-home-2026-05-12T12-50-45-771Z.json`.
- Follow-up report after the commit-review meta-label fix: `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-home-2026-05-12T13-04-36-811Z.json`.
- Follow-up report after review-state and untracked-backup fixes: `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-home-2026-05-16T02-15-38-533Z.json`.
- The profile showed one `thread/list:first-page` request, one `skills/list` request, one `rateLimitsRead` request, and the existing `threadRead=3` warning. No duplicate review-summary request was introduced on the home route.
- The latest profile showed one `thread/list:first-page` request and existing startup warnings for `threadRead=4` and `skillsList=2`; no review-summary fanout was introduced.
- The review-summary path now uses one tracked `git diff --numstat` plus NUL-delimited `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -z`; untracked line counts are streamed from disk instead of reading full files into memory.

### Termux install without native PTY build

#### Feature/Change Name
Android Termux installs can complete when `node-pty` has no compatible native build.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Android device or emulator with Termux installed.
2. Node.js and npm available in Termux.
3. Network access to npm and GitHub.
4. A macOS or Linux desktop remains available for supported-host integrated terminal checks.
5. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher on the desktop check.

#### Steps
1. In Termux, run `npm i -g codexapp@latest` after the fixed version is published.
2. Confirm installation does not fail if npm cannot build `node-pty` for `android-arm64`.
3. Run `codexapp --no-login` in Termux.
4. Open the printed URL and confirm the app loads.
5. Open a thread and confirm the integrated terminal reports unavailable instead of crashing the server if native PTY support is missing.
6. On macOS or Linux, run `npm i -g codexapp@latest`, then start `codexapp --no-login`.
7. Open a thread in light theme and confirm the integrated terminal still opens on the supported host.
8. Switch to dark theme and confirm the integrated terminal remains readable.

#### Expected Results
- Termux install completes even when `node-pty` cannot build on Android.
- The Termux app server starts and the browser UI loads.
- Missing native PTY support disables only the integrated terminal, not the whole app.
- Supported hosts still install `node-pty` and keep integrated terminal behavior in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove test global installs with `npm rm -g codexapp`.

### Composer controls stay editable during responses

#### Feature/Change Name
Model, skill, thinking, and plan controls remain usable while a thread turn is in progress.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. A thread that can produce a long enough response to interact with the composer while the assistant is responding
3. At least one installed skill or saved prompt
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, send a message that starts an assistant response.
2. While the response is still streaming, type a follow-up draft in the composer.
3. Open the model dropdown and select a different model.
4. Open the skills dropdown and select a skill or saved prompt.
5. Open the thinking dropdown and select a different value.
6. Open the attachment menu and toggle plan mode.
7. Verify the stop button and send/queue behavior still match the in-progress turn state.
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1 through 7.

#### Expected Results
- The message textarea remains editable while the assistant is responding.
- Model, skills, thinking, and plan controls are not disabled during the in-progress response.
- Selected controls update the composer state for the next submitted or queued message.
- Stop remains available while no draft content is present, and the submit button switches to the configured steer/queue behavior when draft content exists.
- Light-theme and dark-theme controls remain readable and do not overlap.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any disposable queued messages or test skill selections from the thread.

### Feature: Remove GitHub trending projects from the new-thread screen

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
- Any previously saved local storage value for `codex-web-local.github-trending-projects.v1` may still exist from older builds.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and inspect the available rows.
2. Confirm there is no `GitHub trending projects` toggle.
3. Return to the home/new-thread screen and confirm no trending cards or scope dropdown are shown.
4. Refresh the page and confirm the UI stays unchanged even if the old local storage key exists.

#### Expected Results
- Settings no longer offers any GitHub trending projects preference.
- The home/new-thread screen no longer renders a trending projects section.
- Refreshing does not restore the removed feature from stale local storage.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Dark theme for worktree runtime selector and Skills Hub

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.
- Skills Hub route is accessible.

#### Steps
1. Open the home/new-thread screen and inspect the `Local project / New worktree` runtime selector trigger.
2. Open the runtime selector and verify menu title, options, selected state, and checkmark visibility in dark mode.
3. Trigger a worktree action that shows worktree status and verify running/error status blocks remain readable in dark mode.
4. Open `Skills Hub` and verify header/subtitle, search bar, search/sort buttons, sync panel, badges, and status text.
5. Verify at least one skill card surface (title, owner, description, date, browse icon) in dark mode.
6. Open a skill detail modal and verify panel, title/owner, close button, README/body text, and footer actions in dark mode.

#### Expected Results
- Runtime dropdown trigger and menu use dark backgrounds, borders, and readable text/icons.
- Worktree status blocks use dark-friendly contrast for both running and error states.
- Skills Hub controls and sync panel are fully dark-themed with consistent hover/active states.
- Skill cards and the skill detail modal render with dark theme colors and accessible contrast.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset appearance to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Markdown file links with backticked filename labels render correctly

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open.
- Light and dark themes are both available.
- Local file exists at `/home/ubuntu/andClaw-srcmatch/app/src/main/java/com/coderred/andclaw/ui/util/TrustedBrowserLauncher.kt`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, send a message containing: `Added [`TrustedBrowserLauncher.kt`](/home/ubuntu/andClaw-srcmatch/app/src/main/java/com/coderred/andclaw/ui/util/TrustedBrowserLauncher.kt)`.
2. Confirm the rendered message shows one clickable file link with visible text `TrustedBrowserLauncher.kt`.
3. Click the link and confirm it opens local browse for `/home/ubuntu/andClaw-srcmatch/app/src/main/java/com/coderred/andclaw/ui/util/TrustedBrowserLauncher.kt`.
4. Right-click the same link and choose `Copy link`, then paste it into a text field and inspect it.
5. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-4.

#### Expected Results
- The markdown link renders as one clickable file link instead of splitting around backticks.
- The visible link text is the markdown label `TrustedBrowserLauncher.kt`, without backtick glyphs.
- Clicking opens the local browse route for the full file path.
- Copied link includes the full encoded path and still resolves to the same file.
- Light and dark theme message surfaces keep the link readable and styled consistently.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Deferred ancillary startup refreshes

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one large existing thread is available in the sidebar.
- Browser runtime profiler can run with Playwright from this repository.

#### Steps
1. Open a large thread route directly, for example `#/thread/<thread-id>`.
2. Confirm the thread message history appears before non-critical metadata finishes refreshing.
3. Run `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_ROUTE="#/thread/<thread-id>" PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 node scripts/profile-browser-runtime.cjs`.
4. Open the generated JSON report under `output/playwright/`.
5. Inspect `slowestApiRows` and `duplicateCounts`.

#### Expected Results
- The selected thread uses exactly one `thread/resume` and zero `thread/read` calls during initial load.
- Direct thread route hydration has one owner and does not trigger duplicate selected-thread message loads from route watchers.
- Thread history loading is not blocked by waiting for `skills/list`, `account/rateLimits/read`, or `collaborationMode/list`.
- Skills, model metadata, rate limits, and collaboration modes still populate shortly after the thread is visible.
- The profiler report has no duplicate-load warnings.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*` artifacts if they are not needed for comparison evidence.

### Feature: Runtime selector uses a toggle-style control

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.

#### Steps
1. On the home/new-thread screen, locate the runtime control below `Choose folder`.
2. Verify both options (`Local project` and `New worktree`) are visible at once without opening a menu.
3. Click `New worktree` and confirm it becomes the selected option style.
4. Click `Local project` and confirm selection returns.
5. Set Appearance to `Dark` in Settings and verify selected/unselected contrast remains readable.

#### Expected Results
- Runtime mode is presented as a two-option toggle (segmented control), not a dropdown menu.
- Clicking each option immediately switches the selected state.
- Selected option has a distinct active background/border in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Leave runtime mode and appearance at the previous user preference.

### Feature: Dark theme states for runtime mode toggle

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.

#### Steps
1. Locate the runtime mode toggle (`Local project` and `New worktree`) under `Choose folder`.
2. Hover each option and verify hover state is visible against dark backgrounds.
3. Select `New worktree`, then select `Local project` and compare active/inactive contrast.
4. Tab to the toggle options with keyboard navigation and verify the focus ring is visible.
5. Confirm icon color remains readable for selected and unselected options.

#### Expected Results
- Toggle container, options, and text/icons use dark-friendly colors.
- Hover and selected states are clearly distinguishable in dark mode.
- Keyboard focus ring is visible and does not blend into the background.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Return appearance and runtime selection to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Per-thread model selection

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository against a Codex app-server that supports thread-scoped model persistence.
- At least two selectable models are available in the composer model picker.
- At least one existing thread is available, or you can create one during the test.

#### Steps
1. On the new-thread screen, choose model `A` in the composer.
2. Send a message to create a new thread.
3. In that thread, switch the composer model to model `B`.
4. Send another message in the same thread so the thread persists model `B`.
5. Create or open a different thread and set its model to model `A`.
6. Switch back and forth between the two threads.
7. Refresh the browser while one of the threads is selected.
8. Re-open both threads again after the refresh.
9. While thread `A` is selected, use the sidebar thread menu to fork thread `B`.
10. Open the forked thread and confirm the composer model matches thread `B`, not the currently selected thread.
11. Restart the app-server or otherwise force a model-list refresh that does not include one thread’s persisted model, then switch back to that thread.
12. Delete one of the test threads you changed, refresh the thread list, and continue switching between the remaining thread and the new-thread screen.

#### Expected Results
- Each thread restores its own last selected model when you switch threads.
- The new-thread screen keeps its own draft model selection instead of inheriting the last opened thread.
- After browser refresh, reopening a thread restores the model persisted for that thread.
- Forked or newly created threads keep the resolved model returned by Codex, including fallback to the supported default model when needed.
- Forking a nonselected thread from the sidebar uses that source thread’s persisted model.
- If the selected thread’s persisted model is not returned in the latest model list, the composer still shows that model as the active selection instead of falling back to the placeholder label.
- Removing a thread prunes its saved per-thread model state, and model selection continues to update normally for the remaining threads without runtime errors.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset each tested thread back to its original model selection if you changed an existing conversation for the test.

### Feature: Sandbox approval requests recognize newer Codex payloads

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository with a Codex CLI/app-server version that can request approvals.
- `bubblewrap` is installed so sandboxed command approvals can be triggered.
- Approval policy is set to request approval on sandbox escalation.

#### Steps
1. Start a thread and ask Codex to run a command that requires approval outside the current sandbox.
2. Wait for the pending request panel to appear.
3. Confirm the request is shown as an approval prompt, not the generic fallback with `Return Empty Result` and `Reject Request`.
4. Verify the panel offers approval choices (`Yes`, `Yes for Session`, decline text field, `Skip`).
5. If the approval payload includes a command preview or writable root, verify that preview text is shown in the panel.

#### Expected Results
- Sandbox-related approval requests are classified as approvals even when Codex sends newer method or payload variants.
- The approval UI offers normal approval actions instead of the unknown-request fallback buttons.
- The request stays attached to the correct thread rather than only appearing as a global pending request.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Decline or skip the pending approval request after verification.

### Feature: MCP elicitation requests and thread status labels

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository with a recent Codex CLI/app-server build.
- At least one configured MCP server can trigger `mcpServer/elicitation/request` or `item/permissions/requestApproval`.

#### Steps
1. Start a thread and trigger an MCP flow that asks for user input or permission approval.
2. Confirm the thread row status chip in the sidebar appears in English (`Awaiting approval` or `Awaiting response`).
3. Open the pending request panel for `mcpServer/elicitation/request`.
4. Confirm only the black pending-request panel is shown for the request; no duplicate yellow in-conversation request card should appear.
5. If the elicitation is `form` mode, verify the requested fields are rendered as inputs/selects/checkboxes based on the schema.
6. For a required form field that has no schema default, click `Continue` without answering it and verify the request stays open with a validation error instead of submitting a fabricated answer.
7. For an optional boolean or enum field that has no schema default, verify the control starts unselected rather than prefilled with `False` or the first enum option.
8. If the elicitation is `url` mode, verify an authorization link is shown only when the URL uses `http` or `https`.
9. Submit `Continue`, then repeat and verify `Decline` and `Cancel` are also available.
10. Trigger an `item/permissions/requestApproval` request and verify `Accept` and `Accept for Session` are shown instead of the generic fallback buttons.

#### Expected Results
- MCP elicitation requests no longer fall back to `Return Empty Result` / `Reject Request`.
- Pending requests are shown only once, in the dedicated black pending-request panel.
- Form-mode elicitation requests submit structured `{ action, content }` responses.
- Required MCP form fields without defaults must be answered explicitly before the request can be accepted.
- Optional MCP boolean/enum fields without defaults remain unset until the user chooses a value.
- URL-mode elicitation requests show an authorization link and submit a valid `{ action }` response.
- Non-HTTP(S) authorization URLs are not rendered as clickable links.
- Permissions approval requests submit proper permission grants with turn/session scope.
- Sidebar pending-request chips are displayed in English.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Decline or cancel the MCP request after verification, and close any opened authorization URL if it was only used for testing.

### Feature: pnpm dev script installs dependencies and starts Vite

### Feature: Tailscale CIDRs bypass password and Cloudflare tunnel is opt-in

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository via CLI.
- A Tailscale client can reach the host over Tailscale IPv4 (`100.64.0.0/10`) or IPv6 (`fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`).
- `cloudflared` is installed only if testing `--tunnel`.

#### Steps
1. Start CLI without tunnel flag: `npx codexapp --port 5900`.
2. From a Tailscale client, open `http://100.x.x.x:5900` using a host address in `100.64.0.0/10` (replace with host tailnet IP).
3. Confirm the app opens directly without the password login page.
4. (Optional IPv6 check) Open the same service using the host Tailscale IPv6 address in `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48` and confirm it also bypasses password.
5. Stop the server and start again with tunnel enabled: `npx codexapp --port 5900 --tunnel`.
6. Confirm startup output now includes a `Tunnel:` URL only when `--tunnel` is provided.
7. Stop and restart once more without `--tunnel`, and verify no tunnel URL is printed.

#### Expected Results
- Requests from Tailscale IPv4 `100.64.0.0/10` are treated as trusted and do not require password sign-in.
- Requests from Tailscale IPv6 `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48` are treated as trusted and do not require password sign-in.
- Cloudflare tunnel does not start by default.
- Cloudflare tunnel starts only when `--tunnel` is explicitly passed.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the CLI process.
- If a cloudflared tunnel was started, ensure the tunnel child process has exited.

### Feature: Tunnel auto mode follows Tailscale IP detection

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository via CLI.
- One environment with detected Tailscale IP (`100.64.0.0/10` or `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`) and one without (or simulated by disabling Tailscale).

#### Steps
1. Start server without explicit tunnel flags: `npx codexapp --port 5900`.
2. In a host where Tailscale IP is detected, verify startup output includes `Tunnel:`.
3. In a host where Tailscale IP is not detected, verify startup output does not include `Tunnel:`.
4. Start server with explicit override `--no-tunnel` and verify no `Tunnel:` output even when Tailscale IP is present.
5. Start server with explicit override `--tunnel` and verify `Tunnel:` output even when Tailscale IP is not present.

#### Expected Results
- Without explicit flags, tunnel enablement follows Tailscale IP detection.
- `--no-tunnel` always disables tunnel startup.
- `--tunnel` always enables tunnel startup.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the CLI process after each verification run.
- Ensure cloudflared child process exits after shutdown.

### Feature: Reverse tunnel login is required unless request is trusted local or Tailscale

#### Prerequisites
- App is running with password enabled.
- One direct local browser session (`localhost`).
- One reverse tunnel path (for example SSH/Cloudflare forwarding) that reaches the same server.
- Optional Tailscale client in `100.64.0.0/10` or `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`.

#### Steps
1. Open app via `http://localhost:<port>` and confirm it opens without login when request is true local loopback.
2. Open app via reverse-tunnel URL and confirm login page is shown.
3. Enter correct password in reverse-tunnel URL and confirm session cookie allows access.
4. (Optional) Open app via Tailscale IP and confirm login is bypassed.

#### Expected Results
- Local loopback access is allowed without login prompt.
- Reverse-tunnel access does not bypass auth and requires password.
- Valid login on reverse-tunnel path creates session and grants access.
- Tailscale CIDR requests remain trusted.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear browser cookies for the app origin(s).
- Stop the CLI process.

### Feature: Cloudflare tunnel QR omits password auto-login path

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository with password enabled.
- Cloudflare tunnel startup is enabled (`--tunnel` or auto-enabled path).

#### Steps
1. Start CLI and wait for tunnel output.
2. Verify the printed `Tunnel:` URL does not include a `/password=` suffix.
3. Scan the terminal QR code from a phone/browser.
4. Confirm first page load shows the password form when no trusted bypass applies.
5. Use the generated password file path from startup output to retrieve the password and sign in.

#### Expected Results
- Tunnel URL shown in startup output does not expose the password.
- QR code encodes the base tunnel URL without a password-bearing path.
- The generated password remains available from the local password file.
- Base tunnel URL requires login when no trusted bypass applies.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the CLI process.
- Clear cookies for the tunnel origin if needed.

### Feature: No automatic restore of last active thread on startup

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one existing thread is available.
- Browser local storage is enabled.

#### Steps
1. Open the app in a regular browser tab (`http://localhost:<port>/`), select any thread, then navigate back to home route (`#/`).
2. Refresh the browser tab.
3. Confirm the app remains on home route and does not auto-switch to `#/thread/:threadId`.
4. Install/open the app in PWA standalone mode, select any thread, navigate to `#/`, and relaunch the PWA.

#### Expected Results
- In regular browser-tab mode, startup does not restore and redirect to the last active thread.
- In PWA standalone mode, startup also does not restore and redirect to the last active thread.
- Existing `openProjectPath` startup behavior still opens the requested project on home.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear app local storage state if you need to reset startup behavior for retesting.

#### Prerequisites
- `pnpm` is installed globally (`npm i -g pnpm` or via corepack).
- Repository is cloned and `node_modules/` does not exist (or may be stale).

#### Steps
1. Remove `node_modules/` if present: `rm -rf node_modules`.
2. Run `pnpm run dev`.
3. Wait for Vite dev server to start and display the local URL.
4. Open the displayed URL in a browser.

#### Expected Results
- `pnpm install` runs automatically before Vite starts (dependencies are installed).
- Vite dev server starts successfully and serves the app.
- No `npm` commands are invoked.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Stop button interrupts active turn without missing turnId

### Feature: Default runtime uses workspace-write sandbox with on-request approvals

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- No `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE` or `CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY` environment overrides are set for the launch shell.

#### Steps
1. Start the app normally from this repository without passing `--sandbox-mode` or `--approval-policy`.
2. Open the startup logs or terminal output and find the runtime summary.
3. Confirm the reported sandbox mode is `workspace-write`.
4. Confirm the reported approval policy is `on-request`.
5. Restart the app with explicit overrides, for example `--sandbox-mode danger-full-access --approval-policy never`, and confirm those override the defaults.
6. With those overrides still active, trigger an account flow that uses the temporary app-server path (for example a quota/account inspection request).
7. Confirm the temporary app-server request succeeds under the active override settings and does not behave as if it were still using the original startup defaults.

#### Expected Results
- Default launch uses `workspace-write` sandbox mode.
- Default launch uses `on-request` approval policy.
- Explicit CLI flags still override the defaults when provided.
- Temporary app-server spawns in account routes use the current env-derived runtime args, including CLI overrides.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any temporary CLI overrides before leaving the environment.

### Feature: Backticked HTTP(S) URL renders as clickable link

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open.

#### Steps
1. Send a message containing exactly: `` `https://github.com/marmeladema` ``.
2. Find the rendered message row and inspect the backticked URL token.
3. Click the rendered URL.

#### Expected Results
- The backticked URL is rendered as a clickable link, not plain inline code text.
- Clicking opens `https://github.com/marmeladema` in a new tab.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Stop button interrupts active turn without missing turnId

### Feature: Windows npx install no longer depends on legacy PTY package

#### Prerequisites
- A Windows machine with Node.js and npm installed.
- No globally installed `codexapp` package.
- Clear any previous temporary npm cache for `codexapp` if needed.

#### Steps
1. Run `npx codexapp --no-login` on Windows.
2. Confirm npm does not print deprecation warnings for `prebuild-install`, `npmlog`, `are-we-there-yet`, or `gauge` during package install.
3. Exit the app, then run `npx codexapp --no-login` again.
4. Run `npm i -g codexapp` on Windows.
5. Start the globally installed CLI with `codexapp --no-login`.
6. On macOS or Linux, start the app normally and confirm the integrated terminal still opens in a thread.
7. Repeat the integrated terminal check in both light theme and dark theme.

#### Expected Results
- Windows `npx` install no longer pulls `node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch` as a required install dependency.
- The deprecated `prebuild-install` dependency chain warnings no longer appear for `codexapp` installation.
- Re-running `npx codexapp --no-login` works without getting stuck in the same failed temporary install loop.
- Global installation succeeds on Windows.
- Integrated terminal continues to work through `node-pty` on supported hosts.
- Light theme and dark theme terminal surfaces remain readable and unchanged.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the global package with `npm rm -g codexapp` if it was installed only for verification.

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread can run a long response (for example, request a large code explanation).

#### Steps
1. Send a prompt that keeps the assistant generating for several seconds.
2. Immediately click the `Stop` button before the first assistant chunk fully completes.
3. Confirm generation halts.
4. Repeat with a resumed/existing in-progress thread (reload app while a turn is running, then click `Stop`).

#### Expected Results
- No error appears saying `turn/interrupt requires turnId`.
- Turn is interrupted successfully in both immediate-stop and resumed-thread scenarios.
- Thread state exits in-progress and the stop control returns to idle.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Revert PR #16 mobile viewport and chat scroll behavior changes

### Feature: Revert new-project folder-browser flow to inline add flow

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
- At least one writable parent directory exists for creating a test project folder.

#### Steps
1. On the home/new-thread screen, open the `Choose folder` dropdown.
2. Click `+ Add new project`.
3. Enter a new folder name (for example `New Project Inline Test`) and click `Open`.
4. Confirm the app selects the newly created/opened project folder.
5. Repeat step 2, but enter an absolute path to an existing folder and click `Open`.

#### Expected Results
- Clicking `+ Add new project` opens inline input inside the dropdown instead of navigating to `/codex-local-browse...`.
- Entering a folder name creates/selects that project under the current base directory.
- Entering an absolute path opens that existing folder without creating a nested directory.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete the test folder created in step 3 if it was created only for verification.

### Feature: Disable auto-restore to last thread when opening home URL

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one existing thread is available.
- Browser local storage may contain previous app state.

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread route and confirm messages are visible.
2. Open `http://localhost:<port>/` (home route) in the same browser profile.
3. Refresh the home route once.
4. Close and re-open the app/tab at the home URL again.

#### Expected Results
- The app remains on the home/new-thread screen and does not auto-navigate to `/thread/<id>`.
- Refreshing home still keeps the user on home.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with enough messages to scroll.
- Test on a mobile-sized viewport (for example 375x812).

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread and scroll up to the middle of the chat history.
2. Wait for an assistant response to stream while staying at the same scroll position.
3. Send a follow-up message and observe chat positioning when completion finishes.
4. Open the composer on mobile and drag within the composer area.
5. Open/close the on-screen keyboard on mobile and verify the page layout remains usable.

#### Expected Results
- Chat behavior matches pre-PR #16 baseline (no PR #16 scroll-preservation logic active).
- No regressions from reverting PR #16 changes in conversation rendering and composer behavior.
- Mobile layout no longer includes PR #16 visual-viewport sync changes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Re-apply PR #16 commits if the reverted behavior is not desired.

### Feature: Thread load capped to latest 10 turns

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread exists with more than 10 turns/messages.

#### Steps
1. Open a long thread that previously caused UI lag during initial load.
2. While the thread is loading, immediately click another thread in the sidebar.
3. Return to the long thread.
4. Count visible loaded history blocks and confirm only the newest portion is shown.
5. Call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/read` for the same thread and inspect `result.thread.turns.length`.
6. Call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/resume` for the same thread and inspect `result.thread.turns.length`.

#### Expected Results
- Initial thread load renders only the most recent 10 turns.
- UI remains responsive during thread load.
- You can switch to another thread without the UI freezing.
- `thread/read` and `thread/resume` RPC responses contain at most 10 turns.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Skills list request scoped to active thread cwd

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Browser DevTools Network tab is open.
- At least two threads exist with different `cwd` values.

#### Steps
1. Reload the app and wait for initial data load.
2. In Network tab, inspect `/codex-api/rpc` requests with method `skills/list`.
3. Verify request params contain `cwds` with only the currently selected thread cwd.
4. Switch to another thread with a different cwd.
5. Inspect the next `skills/list` request and verify `cwds` now contains only the new selected thread cwd.

#### Expected Results

### Feature: Pinned threads persist across reload and prune removed threads

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least two threads exist in the sidebar.

#### Steps
1. Pin two threads from the sidebar using the pin button.
2. Refresh the app page.
3. Confirm the same threads are still shown in the `Pinned` section and in the same order.
4. Archive one of the pinned threads from the thread menu.
5. Refresh the app page again.

#### Expected Results
- Pinned threads are restored after reload from Codex app global state (`~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json` key `thread-pinned-ids`).
- Pin order is preserved between reloads.
- Archived/removed pinned thread is automatically pruned and no stale pinned row remains.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Unpin test threads if needed.
- `skills/list` no longer sends every thread cwd in one request.
- Each `skills/list` call includes at most one cwd for the active thread context.
- Skills list still updates when changing selected thread.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: GitHub Website Redesign — OpenClaw-Inspired Design + Web Demo Link

#### Prerequisites
- The `docs/index.html` file has been updated with the new design.
- A browser is available to view the page locally or via GitHub Pages.

#### Steps
1. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser (local file or via GitHub Pages).
2. Verify the fixed **navigation bar** at top with brand logo, section links, and "Get the App" CTA.
3. Verify the **announcement banner** below nav shows the XCodex WASM link.
4. Verify **hero section** displays lobster emoji, "AnyClaw" title with gradient, tagline, and four CTA buttons: "Try Web Demo", "Google Play", "Download APK", "GitHub".
5. Click **"Try Web Demo"** button — confirm it navigates to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
6. Verify the **stats bar** shows key metrics (2 AI Agents, 1 APK, 0 Root Required, 73MB, infinity).
7. Scroll to **Live Demo** section — verify embedded iframe loads `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` with mock browser chrome.
8. Scroll to **Screenshots** section — verify four images render (2 desktop, 2 mobile).
9. Scroll to **Features** section — verify 6 feature cards in a 3-column grid.
10. Scroll to **Testimonials** section — verify two rows of auto-scrolling marquee cards (row 2 scrolls reverse). Hover to pause.
11. Scroll through **Architecture**, **Boot Sequence**, **Quick Start**, and **Tech Stack** sections — verify content renders.
12. Verify the **footer** includes a "Web Demo" link to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
13. Test responsive at 768px and 480px — nav links collapse, grids single-column, buttons stack vertically.

#### Expected Results
- Page has a dark, premium feel with gradient accents, grain overlay, and smooth animations.
- All links to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` work (announcement, hero CTA, demo section, quick start text, footer).
- Marquee testimonials scroll continuously and pause on hover.
- Embedded iframe demo loads successfully.
- Mobile responsive layout works at all breakpoints.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert `docs/index.html` to previous commit if needed.

### Feature: Keep manual chat scroll position during streaming

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with enough history to allow scrolling away from bottom.

#### Steps
1. Open the thread and scroll upward so latest messages are not visible.
2. Send a new message that produces a streaming assistant response.
3. During streaming, do not scroll and observe viewport position.
4. After streaming completes, verify the viewport remains at the same manual position.

#### Expected Results
- Streaming updates do not force auto-scroll to the bottom when user has manually scrolled away.
- User can continue reading older history while the response streams.
- If the thread is already at the bottom when streaming starts, the latest streaming overlay remains visible.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the scroll-preservation change in `src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue` if manual scroll locking needs to be removed.

### Feature: Rollback API/UI no longer requires turn index in rollback payload

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with at least 2 completed turns.
- Rollback control is visible in the thread conversation message actions.

#### Steps
1. Open any existing thread with multiple turns.
2. In DevTools Network tab, keep `/codex-api/rpc` requests visible.
3. Click rollback on a user or assistant message that is not the newest one.
4. Confirm rollback succeeds and the thread is truncated to the selected turn.
5. Inspect the UI event flow by repeating rollback from a different turn and confirm the selected message can rollback without relying on a numeric turn index.
6. Use dictation resend flow (or "rollback latest user turn" flow) and confirm the latest user turn is rolled back correctly.

#### Expected Results
- Rollback works when triggered from message actions using `turnId` as the identifier.
- No UI path depends on `turnIndex` in rollback event payloads.
- Latest-user-turn rollback flow still works and targets the latest user `turnId`.
- No TypeScript/runtime errors are introduced in rollback interaction.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the updated files if this behavior is not desired:
  - `src/types/codex.ts`
  - `src/api/normalizers/v2.ts`
  - `src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue`
  - `src/App.vue`
  - `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts`

### Feature: Rollback init commit includes `.codex/.gitignore`

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Use a fresh temporary project directory with no existing `.codex/rollbacks/.git` history.

#### Steps
1. In a fresh test project folder, trigger rollback automation init by calling `/codex-api/worktree/auto-commit` with a valid commit message.
2. Verify rollback repo exists at `.codex/rollbacks/.git`.
3. In that rollback repo, run `git --git-dir .codex/rollbacks/.git --work-tree . show --name-only --pretty=format: HEAD`.
4. Confirm `.codex/.gitignore` appears in the file list for the init commit.
5. Open `.codex/.gitignore` and verify `rollbacks/` exists.

#### Expected Results
- First rollback-history commit is `Initialize rollback history`.
- That commit includes `.codex/.gitignore`.
- `.codex/.gitignore` contains `rollbacks/`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the temporary test folder after verification.

### Feature: Deterministic rollback commit + exact lookup with debug logs

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- `worktree git automation` is enabled in UI settings.
- Test thread available where you can send at least 3 user turns.

#### Steps
1. Send a user turn that changes files and completes.
2. Send a user turn that produces no file edits and completes.
3. Send a third user turn and complete it.
4. In rollback git history (`.codex/rollbacks/.git`), verify each completed turn created a commit, including the no-edit turn.
5. Inspect one rollback commit body and confirm it contains the user message text plus `Rollback-User-Message-SHA256: <hash>`.
6. Trigger rollback to the second turn message via UI rollback action.
7. Verify server logs contain `[rollback-debug]` entries for lookup, stash (if dirty), reset, and completion.
8. Temporarily test missing-commit path by calling `/codex-api/worktree/rollback-to-message` with a non-existent message text.

#### Expected Results
- Auto-commit creates a rollback commit for every completed turn (`--allow-empty` behavior).
- Commit body includes the user message and stable hash trailer.
- Rollback uses exact hash-based commit lookup only.
- If exact commit is missing, rollback returns error and does not continue.
- Server logs include `[rollback-debug]` records for commit creation, lookup, stash, reset, and error paths.
- Browser console includes `[rollback-debug]` client-side start/success/error logs for auto-commit and rollback API calls.
- Rollback init no longer fails when `.codex` is ignored globally; init force-adds `.codex/.gitignore`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the changed files if you want previous non-deterministic behavior back.

### Feature: Per-turn changed files panel with lazy diff loading

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Worktree git automation enabled.
- A thread with at least one completed turn that touched files.

#### Steps
1. Open a thread and locate a `Worked for ...` separator message.
2. Expand the worked separator.
3. Verify a changed-files panel appears above command details.
4. Confirm file list entries show file path and `+/-` counts.
5. Click one changed file row to expand it.
6. Verify diff content loads only after expansion (lazy load behavior).
7. Collapse and re-expand the same file row; verify diff reuses loaded content.
8. Switch to another thread and back; verify panel reloads for the active thread context.

#### Expected Results
- Each worked message can show changed files for its turn.
- Diff for a file is fetched only on expand, not for all files upfront.
- Errors (missing commit/diff load failure) are shown inline in the panel.
- Existing command output expand/collapse behavior remains unchanged.
- Changed-files panel still resolves after page refresh or app-server restart.
- Changed-files panel appears at the end of the worked message block (after command rows).

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Worked separator is non-expandable

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- A thread with at least one `Worked for ...` separator.

#### Steps
1. Open a thread and locate a `Worked for ...` message.
2. Click the separator line/text area.
3. Verify no expand/collapse behavior is triggered on the separator itself.
4. Verify changed-files panel still appears below the separator when data exists.

#### Expected Results
- `Worked for ...` acts as a visual separator only (non-interactive).
- Changed-files and command sections are not gated by a worked-separator expand toggle.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Changed-files lookup fallback when turnId metadata is missing

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Playwright CLI available.

#### Steps
1. Create/prepare a test workspace (example: `/tmp/rollback-pw`).
2. Call `/codex-api/worktree/auto-commit` with:
   - `cwd=/tmp/rollback-pw`
   - `message='pw-msg-turn-1'`
   - `turnId='turn-real-1'`
3. Call `/codex-api/worktree/message-changes` with:
   - same `cwd`
   - same `message`
   - mismatched `turnId='turn-wrong'`
4. Verify response is still `200` and returns the matching commit data (message-hash fallback).
5. Capture Playwright artifact screenshot.

#### Expected Results
- `message-changes` first attempts turnId lookup.
- If turnId lookup misses, it falls back to exact message-hash lookup.
- API returns commit data instead of `No matching commit found for this user message` when message matches.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary test workspace if created.

### Feature: Changed-files panel persists across refresh (assistant message level)

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Existing thread in `TestChat` project with completed assistant messages.
- Worktree rollback auto-commit enabled.

#### Steps
1. Open a `TestChat` thread and confirm assistant message cards render.
2. Verify changed-files panel is shown at the end of assistant messages that have rollback commit data.
3. Hard refresh the page.
4. Re-open the same `TestChat` thread.
5. Verify changed-files panel is still shown for the same assistant message(s).
6. Expand one file diff and verify diff content loads.

#### Expected Results
- Changed-files panel is attached to assistant messages (not transient worked separators).
- Changed-files panel appears only once per turn (on the last assistant message in that turn).
- Changed-files panel is hidden while a turn is still in progress.
- Panels remain available after refresh/restart because lookup is turnId/message-hash based.
- File diff expansion still lazy-loads and displays content.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Rollback debug logs controlled by `.env`

#### Prerequisites
- App server stopped.
- Edit `.env` directly, and use `.env.local` for private local overrides.

#### Steps
1. Set `ROLLBACK_DEBUG=0` and `VITE_ROLLBACK_DEBUG=0` in `.env`.
2. Start app and trigger rollback auto-commit/message-changes flow.
3. Verify `[rollback-debug]` logs are not emitted in terminal/browser console.
4. Set `ROLLBACK_DEBUG=1` and `VITE_ROLLBACK_DEBUG=1` in `.env`.
5. Restart app and trigger the same flow again.
6. Verify `[rollback-debug]` logs appear in terminal/browser console.

#### Expected Results
- Debug logs are disabled when env flags are `0`.
- Debug logs are enabled when env flags are `1`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore `.env` values to preferred defaults.

### Feature: Auto-commit default is disabled for new preference state

#### Prerequisites
- App server running from this repository.
- Browser local storage key `codex-web-local.worktree-git-automation.v1` is absent (new user state).

#### Steps
1. Open the app in a fresh browser profile (or clear only `codex-web-local.worktree-git-automation.v1`).
2. Open Settings and inspect the `Rollback commits` toggle state.
3. Confirm it starts in the disabled/off state.
4. Enable the toggle manually.
5. Reload the page and confirm the toggle remains enabled.
6. Disable it again, reload, and confirm it remains disabled.

#### Expected Results
- Default state is disabled when no prior preference exists.
- User-selected state persists via local storage across reloads.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Skills sync pull live-reloads installed skills list

#### Prerequisites
- App running from this repository with Skills Hub available.
- GitHub skills sync configured and connected.
- At least one skill update available in the sync source (new or edited skill metadata).

#### Steps
1. Open the app and note the currently visible installed skills for the active thread cwd.
2. In Skills Hub, trigger `Pull` from GitHub sync.
3. Wait for the pull success toast.
4. Without restarting the app/server, navigate to thread composer skill picker and verify the installed skills list.
5. Switch to another thread and back to force a normal UI refresh path.

#### Expected Results
- Pull completes successfully.
- Installed skills list reflects pulled changes immediately without app/server restart.
- Thread switch keeps showing the updated skills list (no stale cache rollback).

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- If needed, run another sync pull/push to restore previous skill state in the sync repo.

### Feature: Public shared skills pull overwrites only shared skills

#### Prerequisites
- App running from this repository with Skills Hub available.
- GitHub skills sync is not configured/logged in.
- Local shared skills directory exists at `~/.codex/skills/shared_skills`.

#### Steps
1. Create a temporary local-only skill folder under `~/.codex/skills/shared_skills`, or edit a tracked shared skill file in that directory.
2. Note the parent `~/.codex/skills` status, including any unrelated local edits outside `shared_skills`.
3. Open `Skills Hub`.
4. Trigger `Pull` from the `Skills Sync (GitHub)` panel.
5. Wait for the pull success toast.
6. Inspect `~/.codex/skills/shared_skills` and compare it with the public `OpenClawAndroid/skills` `android` branch.
7. Inspect `~/.codex/skills` and verify unrelated parent-level files were not reset or cleaned by the unauthenticated pull.
8. If `~/.codex/skills/shared_skills/.git` is a git file or worktree/submodule-style pointer, repeat the pull and verify the nested repo is not reinitialized.
9. Inspect the `/codex-api/skills-sync/pull` response and verify `data.synced` matches the number of direct shared skill folders with `SKILL.md`.
10. In light theme, verify the Skills Hub list reloads and does not show stale local-only skills.
11. Switch to dark theme and verify the same Skills Hub state remains readable and current.

#### Expected Results
- Public unauthenticated pull resets only the nested `shared_skills` repo to the public upstream `android` branch.
- Local uncommitted edits and local-only untracked skill folders inside `shared_skills` are removed by the pull.
- Parent-level `~/.codex/skills` files outside `shared_skills` are not reset or cleaned.
- Existing git-file/worktree/submodule-style shared skills repos are reused, not reinitialized.
- The pull response reports the shared skills count from `~/.codex/skills/shared_skills`, not the parent skills directory.
- The installed skills list reloads immediately after the pull in both light and dark theme.
- Private GitHub sync repos still preserve local edits through the bidirectional sync path.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Recreate any intentionally removed local-only shared skill if it should be kept.
- Use private sync `Push` only after confirming the public pull result should be mirrored elsewhere.

### Feature: Force Refresh Skills button in Skills Sync panel

#### Prerequisites
- App running from this repository with Skills Hub route accessible.
- At least one installed skill is available for the current thread cwd.

#### Steps
1. Open `Skills Hub`.
2. In `Skills Sync (GitHub)`, click `Force Refresh Skills`.
3. Verify button text changes to `Refreshing...` during the request and returns after completion.
4. Verify success toast appears.
5. Open the thread composer skills picker and confirm installed skills list is present and current.
6. Switch to another thread and back to ensure refreshed list remains consistent.

#### Expected Results
- `Force Refresh Skills` triggers a manual refresh without requiring pull/push.
- Loading state prevents duplicate clicks while refresh is in progress.
- Installed skills list updates immediately and remains updated across thread switches.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: SkillHub shows detailed skill load errors

#### Prerequisites
- App running from this repository.
- At least one invalid installed skill file exists (for example unresolved merge markers in `SKILL.md`).

#### Steps
1. Open `Skills Hub`.
2. Trigger `Force Refresh Skills`.
3. Locate the `Some skills failed to load` panel above the skills sections.
4. Verify each row shows:
   - the failing `SKILL.md` path
   - the exact parser error message from app server (for example invalid YAML line/column details).
5. Fix the invalid skill file and trigger `Force Refresh Skills` again.

#### Expected Results
- SkillHub surfaces app-server load failures with detailed path and message.
- Messages are specific enough to identify the broken file and parser failure reason.
- Error panel disappears after invalid skills are fixed and refreshed.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore any intentionally broken local skill files used for testing.

### Feature: Startup sync preserves local skill edits when remote is ahead

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured to a private GitHub fork.
- Local skills repo has a tracked edit in an existing skill file.
- Remote `main` has at least one newer commit than local (simulate from another machine or commit directly on GitHub).

#### Steps
1. Edit a local skill file (for example update description text in `SKILL.md`) and keep the change.
2. Trigger `Startup Sync` in Skills Hub.
3. If a non-fast-forward condition exists, allow startup sync to complete retry path.
4. Re-open the same local skill file and verify your edit remains.
5. Trigger `Force Refresh Skills` and verify no unexpected skill removals occurred.

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync no longer fails with non-fast-forward push due to missing remote integration.
- Local tracked skill edits remain after sync (not overwritten by remote state).
- Sync path rebases/pulls with autostash and auto-resolves conflicts by mtime policy:
  - choose remote (`theirs`) when remote file commit time is newer than local file mtime.
  - choose local (`ours`) otherwise.
- No manual conflict intervention is required during startup sync retries.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert test-only skill text changes if they were not intended to keep.

### Feature: Startup sync conflict fallback when one side is missing

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync repo contains a conflict candidate where only one side exists for a path (for example delete/modify scenario).
- Skills Hub is accessible.

#### Steps
1. Open `Skills Hub`.
2. Click `Startup Sync`.
3. Wait for sync completion or error toast.
4. Verify no toast/error contains `does not have our version`.

#### Expected Results
- Sync conflict resolver handles missing `--ours`/`--theirs` versions safely.
- Startup sync does not fail with `git checkout --ours/--theirs` missing-version errors.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Remote changes win when no local uncommitted skill edits exist

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured with GitHub.
- Local skills repo working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty under skills dir).
- Remote skills repo has newer commits touching existing skill files.

#### Steps
1. Confirm no local uncommitted changes in skills directory.
2. Trigger `Startup Sync` in Skills Hub.
3. After sync, inspect the skill file changed remotely.
4. Trigger `Force Refresh Skills` and confirm loaded skill content matches remote update.

#### Expected Results
- Sync pull/reconcile does not preserve stale local file content when local tree is clean.
- Remote updates are applied locally and remain after startup sync completes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Startup sync does not delete remote AGENTS.md

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured to `friuns2/codexskills`.
- Remote `main` contains `AGENTS.md`.
- Local skills repo is clean before startup sync.

#### Steps
1. Confirm remote `AGENTS.md` exists on `main`.
2. Confirm local `~/.codex/skills` is clean.
3. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. After completion, inspect latest commit created by sync (if any).
5. Verify `AGENTS.md` still exists locally and in remote `origin/main`.

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync may update manifest, but must not delete `AGENTS.md`.
- If sync creates a commit, changed files do not include `D AGENTS.md`.
- Local and remote `AGENTS.md` hashes remain equal after sync.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Bidirectional AGENTS.md sync via Startup Sync

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured to `friuns2/codexskills`.
- `~/.codex/skills` is a clean git working tree before each sub-test.
- Skills Hub startup sync endpoint is reachable.

#### Steps
1. Remote -> Local:
2. Add a unique marker to remote `AGENTS.md` on `main`.
3. Confirm local `HEAD` is behind `origin/main`.
4. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
5. Verify local `AGENTS.md` contains the remote marker and local `HEAD == origin/main`.
6. Local -> Remote:
7. Add a different unique marker to local `~/.codex/skills/AGENTS.md`.
8. Confirm local working tree shows `M AGENTS.md`.
9. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
10. Verify remote `origin/main:AGENTS.md` contains the local marker and local `HEAD == origin/main`.

#### Expected Results
- Remote-only AGENTS edits are pulled into local without deletion.
- Local AGENTS edits are pushed to remote after startup sync.
- After each sync direction, local and remote commit SHAs match.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary test markers from `AGENTS.md` if required.

### Feature: Mixed local+remote AGENTS edits do not stall Startup Sync

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured and working.
- Local skills repo clean before test start.

#### Steps
1. Add marker `A` to remote `AGENTS.md`.
2. Add marker `B` to local `AGENTS.md` before syncing.
3. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. Wait for startup status to finish (`inProgress=false`).
5. Verify sync outcome explicitly:
6. If sync succeeds, local/remote SHAs match and expected merged marker result is present.
7. If sync fails, status includes a concrete error message (not silent success).

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync must not report success while local remains behind remote.
- No stale stash side-effects are introduced (no unexpected conflict from old stash entries).
- Final state is either a valid synchronized result or an explicit failure status with actionable error.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset local skills repo to `origin/main` after test if needed.

### Feature: Startup sync uses deterministic pull reconcile (`fetch + reset --hard`) before local replay

#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync is logged in and targets `friuns2/codexskills`.
- Local repo path is `~/.codex/skills`.
- Startup Sync endpoint is reachable at `/codex-api/skills-sync/startup-sync`.

#### Steps
1. Remote-only case:
2. Commit a unique marker to remote `AGENTS.md` on `main`.
3. Ensure local repo is clean and reset to `origin/main`, then trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. Confirm marker appears locally and `HEAD == origin/main`.
5. Local-only case:
6. Add a unique local marker to `~/.codex/skills/AGENTS.md` (uncommitted), trigger `Startup Sync`.
7. Confirm marker is pushed and `HEAD == origin/main` with clean worktree.
8. Mixed case:
9. Add local marker first, then commit a newer remote marker.
10. Trigger `Startup Sync` and verify mtime policy result (newer remote marker wins, older local marker dropped).
11. Confirm final state is clean with `HEAD == origin/main`.

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync does not fail with missing merge refs (`MERGE_HEAD`/`REBASE_HEAD`) in this path.
- Remote-only changes are always pulled first and visible locally.
- Local-only changes are preserved and pushed during the same startup sync run.
- Mixed local+remote edits converge automatically with no manual conflict handling.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary test markers from `AGENTS.md` if not needed.

### Feature: Revert Renat scrolling/input-layout behavior (without Fast mode changes)

#### Prerequisites
- App builds successfully (`pnpm run build`).
- Open a thread with enough messages to scroll.
- Composer is visible in the main chat view.

#### Steps
1. Open a long thread and scroll upward away from bottom.
2. Trigger live overlay updates (for example by sending a new prompt) and observe scroll behavior.
3. Confirm message list horizontal overflow behavior in conversation and desktop main area.
4. In composer, verify there is no drag/drop overlay UI when dragging files over the input.
5. In composer, paste an image from clipboard and verify it is not auto-attached through paste handler.
6. Use file picker/camera attach buttons and confirm attachments still work.
7. Confirm Fast mode UI/toggle remains present and unchanged.

#### Expected Results
- Scroll behavior follows reverted layout logic for conversation/desktop containers.
- Composer drag-active overlay is removed from the input field layout.
- Clipboard image paste no longer triggers drag/paste attachment flow.
- Standard picker-based attachments still work.
- Fast mode button and related controls are unchanged.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- `git restore src/components/content/ThreadComposer.vue src/components/content/ThreadConversation.vue src/components/layout/DesktopLayout.vue src/style.css tests.md`

### Feature: Chat file-link context menu (open/copy/edit)

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Open a thread that contains rendered `.message-file-link` anchors (for example Markdown file links).

#### Steps
1. In a message with a file link, right-click the file link text.
2. Verify the custom context menu appears near the pointer.
3. Click `Open link` and confirm the link opens in a new tab.
4. Right-click the same file link again and click `Copy link`, then paste into a text input to verify copied value.
5. For links under `/codex-local-browse...`, right-click and click `Edit file`.
6. Click outside the menu and press `Escape` while the menu is open.

#### Expected Results
- Right-clicking any `.message-file-link` opens the custom context menu.
- Menu includes `Open link` and `Copy link` for all links.
- Menu includes `Edit file` only for browseable local file links.
- Pointer-down outside, blur, and `Escape` close the menu.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Close any tabs opened during the test.

### Feature: Dark theme command rows in chat remain readable

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Open any thread that contains command execution entries.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.

#### Steps
1. Open a thread with one or more command execution rows in the conversation.
2. Verify command label text, grouped command label text, and status text in collapsed rows.
3. Locate a file-change summary row (for example: `▶ 2 files changed · 2 edited`) and verify the chevron and summary text are readable.
4. Expand a command row to show output and inspect the output panel border contrast.
5. Confirm status colors for running/success/error command rows are distinguishable in dark mode.
6. Toggle back to `Light` theme and confirm command rows still use the existing light styling.

#### Expected Results
- Command labels and grouped command labels are readable against dark row backgrounds.
- File-change summary rows keep readable chevron and summary text in dark mode.
- Default status text is readable in dark mode.
- Running/success/error status colors remain visible in dark mode.
- Expanded command output border is visible without using a bright light-theme border.
- Light theme command row styling is unchanged.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Return appearance setting to the previous user preference.

### Feature: Home composer vertical alignment matches reference layout

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open the `New thread` (home) screen with a selected folder/project.
- Ensure desktop viewport width (for example >= 1280px).

#### Steps
1. Open the home screen and observe the hero block (`Let's build`) and composer placement.
2. Confirm the hero/settings block is vertically centered within the available content area.
3. Confirm the message composer sits in the lower area of the content column (not immediately below top content).
4. Resize window height taller/shorter and re-check vertical placement.
5. Open any thread route and verify thread composer layout remains unchanged.

#### Expected Results
- Home hero block is centered again (not top-anchored).
- Home composer aligns toward the bottom region similar to the reference screenshot.
- Resizing preserves the intended centered-hero + lower-composer structure.
- Thread route composer behavior is unchanged.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert the `.new-thread-empty` style in [src/App.vue](/Users/igor/.codex/worktrees/eaf8/codex-web-local/src/App.vue).

### Feature: Restore composer drag-and-drop file attach on input field

#### Prerequisites
- App is running with a selected thread and active composer.
- At least one local file is available to drag from Finder/File Explorer.

#### Steps
1. Drag a file over the composer input area.
2. Confirm drag highlight/overlay appears above the input.
3. Drop the file on the composer input field.
4. Verify the file is attached in composer chips.
5. Repeat with an image file and verify image preview appears.
6. In dark mode, repeat steps 1-2 and verify overlay remains readable.

#### Expected Results
- Composer shows drag-active visual state while file is hovering.
- Dropped files are attached through the same attachment pipeline as regular uploads.
- Image drops create image preview attachments.
- Dark mode drag overlay uses dark-theme colors and remains legible.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove attached files/images from the composer before closing the test thread.

### Feature: Restore clipboard image paste attachments in composer

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open any thread where the composer is enabled.
- Have an image copied to system clipboard (for example screenshot copy).

#### Steps
1. Focus the composer textarea.
2. Paste clipboard content that contains only an image file payload.
3. Confirm an image chip/preview is added to composer attachments.
4. Copy plain text only and paste into composer.
5. Copy mixed content (plain text + image, if source provides both) and paste once.
6. Copy long plain text (at least 2000 characters) and paste into composer.
7. Confirm the long text is attached as a `.txt` file instead of being inserted into the textarea.
8. Send the message with the pasted image/text attachment.

#### Expected Results
- Image-only clipboard paste adds an image attachment to composer.
- Plain-text paste still inserts text into the composer and does not create an attachment.
- Mixed payload paste attaches the image while preserving text paste behavior.
- Long plain-text paste (>= 2000 chars) creates a `.txt` attachment and does not insert raw text into the textarea.
- Sending proceeds with the attached pasted image.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the attached image chip from composer if not needed.

### Feature: Show user file attachments as visible chips in chat

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open any thread with an active composer.
- Have at least one local file available to attach.

#### Steps
1. Attach one or more files via composer (file picker, paste long text as `.txt`, or other file attachment flow).
2. Send the message.
3. Locate the sent user message in conversation.
4. Verify file attachment chips are rendered above message text.
5. Click a file chip and confirm it opens the browse URL in a new tab/window.
6. Right-click the chip link and verify file-link context actions still appear (`Open link`, `Copy link`, and `Edit file` when applicable).

#### Expected Results
- Sent user messages with `fileAttachments` show visible file chips in chat.
- Chip labels match attachment labels from composer payload.
- Chip links resolve through browse URLs and remain clickable.
- Existing file-link context menu behavior works on the chip links.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Close any opened file tabs and remove temporary test messages if needed.

### Feature: Frontend missing-entry 404 page auto-redirects to chat

#### Prerequisites
- Build or runtime state where frontend entry cannot be served (for example missing `dist/index.html`).
- Start server and open the failing route in a browser.

#### Steps
1. Trigger the frontend missing-entry error page.
2. Confirm the page shows an error headline and a `Back to chat` link.
3. Wait 3 seconds without clicking the link.
4. Repeat and click `Back to chat` immediately.

#### Expected Results
- Error page still renders with the manual `Back to chat` link.
- Page automatically redirects to `/` after about 3 seconds.
- Manual link works instantly and is not blocked by the timer.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore frontend assets (`pnpm run build:frontend`) if they were intentionally removed for testing.

### Feature: Import 10 working DB accounts and keep Accounts section collapsed by default

#### Prerequisites
- Have a SQLite DB with `account_tokens.refresh_token` rows (default path: `/Users/igor/Git-projects/any-auto-register/account_manager.db`).
- Network access available for token exchange against OpenAI OAuth endpoint.
- Codex home available at `~/.codex` (or set `CODEX_HOME`).
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).

#### Steps
1. Run `scripts/import-working-accounts-from-db.sh`.
2. Verify script reports `imported` rows and ends with `done imported=<n>` where `n <= 10`.
3. Open `~/.codex/accounts.json` and verify new account entries were appended/updated.
4. Verify snapshot files exist under `~/.codex/accounts/<sha256(account_id)>/auth.json`.
5. Open app settings and check the `Accounts` section is collapsed on first load.
6. Click the chevron toggle in Accounts header to expand.
7. Confirm account list/error/empty state renders correctly after expanding.
8. Reload the page and confirm collapsed/expanded state persists.

#### Expected Results
- Script imports up to 10 valid (token-exchange-successful) accounts and skips invalid tokens.
- `accounts.json` and per-account snapshot `auth.json` files are created with secure file modes.
- Accounts panel in settings is collapsed by default when no saved preference exists.
- User can expand/collapse Accounts via header toggle, and the state persists in localStorage.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove imported snapshots from `~/.codex/accounts/` and corresponding rows in `~/.codex/accounts.json` if needed.
- Delete localStorage key `codex-web-local.accounts-section-collapsed.v1` to reset UI preference.

### Feature: Copy Codex accounts to Android via ssh helper script

#### Prerequisites
- Local Codex state exists at `~/.codex/accounts` and `~/.codex/accounts.json`.
- Android helper exists and is executable: `/Users/igor/Git-projects/codex-web-local-android/andclaw/ssh.sh`.
- Android target is reachable through helper SSH path.

#### Steps
1. Run `scripts/copy-accounts-to-android.sh`.
2. Confirm script prints local account count and upload/extract progress.
3. Confirm script prints remote account count.
4. Verify script exits successfully with `Copy complete: local and remote counts match.`
5. On Android host, verify `~/.codex/accounts.json` exists and snapshots under `~/.codex/accounts/*/auth.json` are present.

#### Expected Results
- Script packs `accounts/` and `accounts.json`, uploads and extracts on Android.
- Local and remote `auth.json` snapshot counts match.
- Script exits non-zero on mismatch or missing prerequisites.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove remote copied data if needed: delete `~/.codex/accounts` and `~/.codex/accounts.json` on Android host.

### Feature: Accounts no longer stuck on "Fetching account details…"

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have at least one imported account in the Accounts section.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. Ensure at least one account has no immediately available quota snapshot (for example right after import/refresh, or by waiting for quota read failure).
3. Observe the quota/status line for that account after the initial fetch completes.
4. Trigger `Reload` in the Accounts header and wait for account list update.
5. Re-check accounts that are not in `Loading quota…` state.

#### Expected Results
- `Fetching account details…` appears only while the entry is truly in transient loading.
- Accounts that are not loading and still have no quota snapshot show `Quota unavailable` instead of a perpetual fetching label.
- Existing `Loading quota…` and explicit error messages continue to render correctly.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Account quota background refresh recovers from stale loading and inspection hangs

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have multiple imported accounts in `~/.codex/accounts.json`.
- At least one account previously left with `quotaStatus: "loading"` for longer than 2 minutes, or one account that causes quota inspection to hang.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. Trigger account list refresh by loading the page or clicking `Reload`.
3. Monitor `~/.codex/accounts.json` and confirm stale `loading` accounts are re-picked for refresh (not ignored indefinitely).
4. Wait at least 30 seconds when one account is slow/hanging.
5. Verify other accounts continue progressing instead of all remaining blocked.
6. Re-open the Accounts section and inspect final status labels for previously stuck accounts.

#### Expected Results
- `loading` states older than 2 minutes are retried automatically.
- A single hanging account inspection times out (about 25 seconds) and transitions to `error` rather than blocking the whole queue forever.
- Remaining accounts continue refreshing to `ready` as data becomes available.
- UI no longer stays indefinitely stuck waiting on one blocked account refresh.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Account quota label uses primary snapshot when windowMinutes is missing

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have accounts where `quotaSnapshot.primary` exists but `windowMinutes` can be null.

#### Steps
1. Open Settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. Click `Reload` and wait for account statuses to settle to `ready`.
3. Inspect account rows that previously showed `Quota unavailable` while backend had `quotaSnapshot.primary.usedPercent`.
4. Verify displayed quota labels in UI and account card titles.

#### Expected Results
- Accounts with `quotaSnapshot.primary` show a remaining-percent quota label.
- `Quota unavailable` appears only when there is truly no usable quota snapshot data.
- Team/free accounts both render quota labels consistently when primary snapshot is present.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Default runtime uses unrestricted sandbox and no approvals

#### Prerequisites
- Build artifacts are available (or run directly from source in this repo).
- No `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE` or `CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY` environment variables are exported in the shell.

#### Steps
1. Start the app from this repository without passing `--sandbox-mode` or `--approval-policy`.
2. Observe startup logs for the printed runtime config lines.
3. Confirm the logs show `Codex sandbox: danger-full-access` and `Approval policy: never`.
4. Stop the app and restart with explicit overrides, for example `--sandbox-mode workspace-write --approval-policy on-request`.
5. Confirm startup logs now show the override values.

#### Expected Results
- Default startup (no flags/env) uses `danger-full-access` sandbox and `never` approval policy.
- Explicit CLI overrides still take precedence and are applied correctly.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Unset any temporary env vars used for override checks.

### Feature: npm run dev exports unrestricted runtime defaults

#### Prerequisites
- Node and pnpm are installed.
- No shell-level `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE` or `CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY` overrides are set.

#### Steps
1. Run `npm run dev` from the repository root.
2. In a second terminal, run `ps eww -p $(pgrep -f "vite" | head -n 1)`.
3. Confirm the process environment contains `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE=danger-full-access` and `CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY=never`.
4. Stop dev server and run `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE=workspace-write CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY=on-request npm run dev`.
5. Re-check the Vite process environment values.

#### Expected Results
- Default `npm run dev` includes `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE=danger-full-access` and `CODEXUI_APPROVAL_POLICY=never`.
- Explicit shell overrides still take precedence when provided.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop running dev servers and unset temporary env overrides.

### Feature: npm run dev uses CLI server on Android

#### Prerequisites
- Android SSH helper exists and is executable: `/Users/igor/Git-projects/codex-web-local-android/andClaw/ssh.sh`.
- Dependencies are installed on the Android clone.

#### Steps
1. On Android, run `npm run dev -- --port 4173`.
2. Confirm startup logs show `Codex Web Local is running!`.
3. In a second Android shell, run `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4173/ | head -5`.
4. Stop the dev server.

#### Expected Results
- Android starts `node dist-cli/index.js`, not raw Vite.
- The server binds successfully and returns the app HTML.
- The Vite `uv_interface_addresses` Android error does not occur.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the Android dev server.

### Feature: Approval request uses legacy in-conversation request card only

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open a thread where Codex can trigger an approval request (for example a command or file-change approval).

#### Steps
1. Trigger an approval request in an existing thread.
2. Observe the conversation timeline where server requests are rendered.
3. Observe the composer area at the bottom of the thread.
4. Confirm the approval controls are shown in the in-conversation request card.
5. Confirm no separate composer waiting-state approval panel is rendered.

#### Expected Results
- Exactly one approval UI is visible for the active pending request.
- The approval UI appears in the conversation request card.
- Composer continues to show the standard composer UI without a separate approval panel.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Rollback appends rolled-back user text into composer input

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Open any non-home thread with at least one completed user/assistant turn.
- Composer input is visible in the thread view.

#### Steps
1. In the selected thread, locate a message row with a visible rollback action.
2. Click rollback for a specific turn whose user prompt text is known.
3. Observe the composer input immediately after clicking rollback.
4. If composer already had text, verify the rolled-back user text is appended on a new line.
5. Confirm the thread rollback still completes and the turn is removed from the conversation.

#### Expected Results
- Before rollback completes, the original user message text from that turn is inserted into the composer input.
- Existing composer draft text is preserved and the restored text is appended.
- Rollback behavior still removes the selected turn(s) as before.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear composer input if restored text is no longer needed.

### Feature: New thread worktree creation supports searchable base-branch selector

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Use a folder that is inside a Git repository with at least two branches (for example `main` and a feature branch).

#### Steps
1. Open the `New thread` screen.
2. Select a project folder that points to a Git repository.
3. Change runtime to `New worktree`.
4. Verify a `Base branch` dropdown appears.
5. Open the dropdown and type part of a branch name in search.
6. Select a non-default branch from the filtered list.
7. Submit the first message to trigger worktree creation.
8. In the opened thread, confirm `cwd` points to a new worktree path under `~/.codex/worktrees/`.
9. In terminal, run `git -C <new-worktree-path> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and `git -C <new-worktree-path> merge-base HEAD <selected-base-branch>`.

#### Expected Results
- `Base branch` selector is visible only in `New worktree` mode.
- Dropdown supports search/filter for branch names.
- Worktree creation succeeds and creates a new branch named `codex/<id>`.
- New worktree branch is based on the selected branch (merge-base confirms expected ancestry).

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary worktree after verification: `git -C <repo-root> worktree remove <new-worktree-path>`.
- Delete temporary branch if needed: `git -C <repo-root> branch -D codex/<id>`.

### Feature: Worktree branch selector sorts branches by last active commit

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Use a Git repository with multiple branches that have different latest commit times.

#### Steps
1. Open `New thread`.
2. Select the Git project folder.
3. Set runtime to `New worktree`.
4. Open the `Base branch` dropdown.
5. Note the first 3-5 branches shown.
6. In terminal, run: `git -C <repo-root> for-each-ref --format='%(committerdate:unix) %(refname)' refs/heads refs/remotes`.
7. Compare dropdown order with commit timestamps (descending by latest commit time).

#### Expected Results
- Branches are ordered by most recently active commit first.
- If a branch exists in both local and remote refs, it appears once.
- Ties are ordered alphabetically by branch name.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: New worktree base-branch dropdown aligns on same row to the right

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open `New thread` and select a Git project folder.

#### Steps
1. On desktop width (>=1024px), switch runtime to `New worktree`.
2. Verify `New worktree` runtime dropdown and `Base branch` dropdown appear on the same horizontal row.
3. Verify `Base branch` control is positioned to the right of runtime mode control.
4. Switch runtime back to `Local project`.
5. Verify branch dropdown disappears while runtime control remains aligned.
6. Resize viewport to mobile width (~375px) and switch back to `New worktree`.
7. Verify controls stack vertically for mobile readability.

#### Expected Results
- Desktop: runtime and branch controls are on one row, with branch selector on the right.
- Local runtime hides the branch selector without breaking layout.
- Mobile view stacks controls vertically.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: New worktree creation uses detached HEAD parity behavior

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Select a Git-backed folder on `New thread`.

#### Steps
1. Set runtime to `New worktree`.
2. Choose any base branch in `Base branch` dropdown.
3. Send first message to trigger worktree creation.
4. Copy resulting worktree `cwd` from thread context.
5. Run `git -C <worktree-cwd> status --branch --porcelain`.
6. Run `git -C <worktree-cwd> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.

#### Expected Results
- Worktree is created successfully.
- Git status reports detached HEAD state (no local branch checkout).
- `rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns `HEAD`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove test worktree when done: `git -C <repo-root> worktree remove <worktree-cwd>`.

### Feature: Thread RPC strips inline image/file payloads into links

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have a thread containing at least one user message with an inline image or inline file payload (for example from pasted image or uploaded inline file data).

#### Steps
1. Open browser devtools Network tab.
2. Load a thread so the frontend calls `POST /codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/read`.
3. Inspect the JSON response body under `result.thread.turns[*].items[*].content[*]`.
4. Find entries that previously carried inline `data:` payloads.
5. Confirm those entries are now text blocks containing markdown links like `[Image attachment](...)` or `[File attachment](...)`.

#### Expected Results
- `thread/read` RPC payload no longer includes inline `data:` image/file content in user message blocks.
- Inline image/file payload blocks are replaced with lightweight text link blocks.
- Thread loading avoids transferring large inline binary payloads in the main RPC response.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Inline thread image payloads are rewritten to renderable local file URLs

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have a thread that includes a user inline image block originally stored as a `data:` payload.

#### Steps
1. Open the thread in the chat UI.
2. Confirm the message area where the inline image appears.
3. Open Network tab and inspect `POST /codex-api/rpc` `thread/read` response.
4. Verify image block now has `type: "image"` and `url` with `file://...` (not `data:`).

#### Expected Results
- Inline `data:` image payload is not sent in RPC response.
- UI still renders the image from the generated local file URL.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Rapid thread switching during active load

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Ensure there are at least 3 existing threads with enough history so opening each thread triggers a visible loading state.

#### Steps
1. Open thread A from the sidebar.
2. While thread A is still loading, quickly click thread B and then thread C.
3. Repeat fast switching across multiple threads (for example A -> B -> C -> A) before each load settles.
4. Observe selected row highlight, URL route (`/thread/:threadId`), and conversation content after loading settles.

#### Expected Results
- The final clicked thread is always the selected thread.
- Sidebar highlight, route thread id, and rendered conversation stay in sync.
- No stale intermediate selection remains after rapid clicks.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Thread auto-scrolls to latest message after load

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have a thread with enough messages to require scrolling.

#### Steps
1. Open the long thread from the sidebar.
2. Wait for `Loading messages...` to disappear.
3. Observe the conversation viewport position immediately after load.
4. Switch to another thread, then back to the same long thread.

#### Expected Results
- After each thread load, conversation snaps to the bottom-most/latest message.
- The latest message is visible without manual scrolling.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Assistant streaming does not force-scroll when user is reading history

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open a thread long enough to scroll.

#### Steps
1. Scroll up so latest message is not visible.
2. Send a new prompt and wait for assistant reply to stream.
3. Observe viewport while reply is in progress.
4. Click `Jump to latest` (or manually scroll to bottom).
5. Send another prompt and observe streaming behavior again.

#### Expected Results
- While scrolled up, streaming assistant output does not pull viewport to bottom.
- After returning to bottom, streaming output auto-follows newest content.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: While reading older messages, stream growth keeps viewport pinned

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open a long thread and scroll up away from bottom.

#### Steps
1. Keep viewport fixed on an older message section.
2. Trigger a long assistant response so content height grows continuously.
3. Observe viewport position for 10-20 seconds during streaming.

#### Expected Results
- Viewport stays pinned at the same absolute scroll location while streaming.
- No gradual downward drift occurs until user manually jumps to latest/bottom.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Thread stream parity — stream-first hydration with full turn history

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- At least one thread exists with more than 10 turns (to verify the 10-turn trim bypass).

#### Steps
1. Open a long thread (>10 turns) in the UI.
2. Open DevTools Network tab and inspect the outgoing requests.
3. Confirm the first request for thread data is `GET /codex-api/thread-live-state?threadId=...` (not `POST /codex-api/rpc` with `thread/read`).
4. Inspect the response JSON and confirm `conversationState.turns` contains ALL turns (not trimmed to 10).
5. Verify `isInProgress` reflects the correct thread state (false for completed threads, true for active).
6. Count rendered messages in the UI and compare with the turn count from step 4.
7. Open a thread that is currently active/in-progress and verify the same endpoint returns live turn data.
8. Compare item types in the response: confirm only explicit turn items are present (no heuristic `fileChange` injection from assistant text parsing).
9. Open DevTools and call `fetch('/codex-api/thread-stream-events?threadId=<id>&limit=50').then(r=>r.json()).then(console.log)` and verify the endpoint returns `{ events: [...] }` structure.
10. Simulate a live-state endpoint failure (e.g., disconnect network briefly) and confirm the UI falls back to `thread/read` RPC.

#### Expected Results
- Thread detail loading uses `/codex-api/thread-live-state` as the primary data source.
- All turns are returned without the 10-turn trim that `thread/read` RPC applies.
- Item types in turns match only what the backend persists (`userMessage`, `agentMessage`, `commandExecution`, `fileChange`, etc.) — no heuristic injection.
- `thread/read` RPC is used only as a fallback when the live-state endpoint fails.
- Stream events endpoint returns buffered notification frames for active threads.
- Live command executions during an active turn include `turnId` for strict turn scoping.
- Command execution items are recovered from the session log for old/completed threads.
- Commands are interleaved with agent messages in correct chronological order (not appended at end).
- File change items (from `apply_patch` tool calls) are recovered from the session log with diff data and `kind.type` format.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert commits on `thread-stream-parity` branch if behavior is not desired:
  - `src/server/codexAppServerBridge.ts` (stream endpoints + notification buffering)
  - `src/api/codexGateway.ts` (stream-first hydration)
  - `src/api/normalizers/v2.ts` (removed heuristic file change extraction)
  - `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts` (strict turn scoping on live commands)

### Feature: Thread stream parity works on Linux (Oracle A1 ARM64)

#### Prerequisites
- Oracle A1 server accessible via SSH (`ssh a1`).
- Codex CLI installed on A1 (`codex --version` works).
- Existing Codex sessions with commands and file edits on A1.

#### Steps
1. Clone or pull branch `codex/thread-stream-parity` on A1 into `~/codexui`.
2. Run `pnpm install` and start dev server: `pnpm run dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173`.
3. From A1 locally, call `curl http://localhost:<port>/codex-api/rpc -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"thread/list","params":{},"id":1}'` and verify thread list returns.
4. Pick a thread with known commands and file edits (e.g., MCP server deploy thread).
5. Call `curl http://localhost:<port>/codex-api/thread-live-state?threadId=<id>` and inspect response.
6. Verify `conversationState.turns[*].items` contains `commandExecution` items recovered from session log with correct `command`, `status`, and `aggregatedOutput`.
7. Verify `fileChange` items recovered from `apply_patch` session log entries with `changes[].path`, `changes[].operation`, and `changes[].diff`.
8. Verify items are interleaved chronologically with `agentMessage` items (not all commands at the start or end).
9. Test from Mac via Tailscale: `curl --http1.1 http://100.127.77.25:<port>/codex-api/thread-live-state?threadId=<id>` (use `--http1.1` to avoid Vite HTTP/2 upgrade hang).

#### Expected Results
- Bridge server starts and spawns Codex app-server on Linux ARM64 without errors.
- `thread/list` RPC returns all threads from `~/.codex/sessions/`.
- `thread-live-state` returns full turn history with recovered `commandExecution` and `fileChange` items.
- Session log parsing works with Linux file paths (`/home/ubuntu/.codex/sessions/...`).
- Chronological interleaving matches the order seen on macOS (commands appear between agent messages, not appended).
- Tailscale remote access works with `--http1.1` flag.

#### Verified Results (2026-04-08)
- A1 server: Ubuntu ARM64, Node v22.22.0, Codex CLI 0.101.0.
- Thread `019d62d5-9fa7-7ad2-bab7-b5225d617734`: 21 turns, 120 commands, 17 file changes recovered.
- Thread `019d6a60-d303-7d50-bdf3-7a7f7e38abb1`: 10 turns, 62 commands, 3 file changes recovered.
- Thread `019d658d-ca06-7c80-8ef6-ee22c828b407`: 4 turns, 73 commands, 7 file changes recovered.
- All items correctly interleaved with agent messages in chronological order.
- Command content verified: `command`, `status`, `aggregatedOutput` fields present.
- File change content verified: `changes[].path`, `changes[].operation`, `changes[].diff` fields present.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the dev server on A1: `pkill -f vite`.

### Feature: Rollback undoes apply_patch file changes

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- A thread exists with at least one completed turn that applied file changes via `apply_patch`.
- The thread's `cwd` points to a git-tracked directory.

#### Steps
1. Open a thread with file changes visible in the conversation (file change cards with diffs).
2. Note the current state of a file that was modified by the agent in a recent turn.
3. Click the rollback button on a turn that has file changes.
4. After rollback completes, check the file on disk — it should be restored to the state before the agent modified it.
5. Verify the thread conversation no longer shows the rolled-back turns.
6. For turns that added new files: verify the added files are deleted from disk.
7. For turns that deleted files: verify the deleted files are restored (if they were tracked in git).

#### Expected Results
- Clicking rollback on a turn reverts both the thread history AND the file system changes from that turn and all subsequent turns.
- Files modified by `apply_patch` in rolled-back turns are restored via `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`.
- Files created by `apply_patch` in rolled-back turns are removed from disk.
- Files deleted by `apply_patch` in rolled-back turns are restored from git HEAD.
- File moves in rolled-back turns are reversed (moved file is renamed back to original path).
- If file revert fails (e.g., not a git repo), the thread rollback still proceeds — file revert is best-effort.
- The rollback-files endpoint (`POST /codex-api/thread/rollback-files`) can be called independently for testing.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required — rolled-back files are already restored.

### Feature: Markdown file links with spaces and parentheses in path

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open.
- File exists at `/home/ubuntu/Documents/New Project (2)/hosting_manager.py`.

#### Steps
1. Send this exact message:
   `[hosting_manager.py](/home/ubuntu/Documents/New Project (2)/hosting_manager.py)`
2. In the rendered message, confirm it appears as one clickable file link.
3. Click the link and confirm it opens local browse for the full file path.
4. Right-click and use `Copy link`, then verify pasted URL still points to the same full path.

#### Expected Results
- Markdown link is parsed as one link token (not split at `)` inside the path).
- Clicking navigates to the full file path in local browse view.
- Copied link contains the complete encoded path.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove test file if it was created only for this verification.

### Feature: Markdown link with backticked label renders as file link

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open.
- File exists at `/Users/igor/temp/TestChat/qwe.txt`.

#### Steps
1. Send this exact message:
   [`/Users/igor/temp/TestChat/qwe.txt`](/Users/igor/temp/TestChat/qwe.txt)
2. In the rendered message, confirm it appears as one clickable file link.
3. Verify the visible link text is `/Users/igor/temp/TestChat/qwe.txt` (without backticks).
4. Click the link and confirm it opens local browse for the full file path.

#### Expected Results
- Backticks inside markdown label do not break markdown-link parsing.
- The label renders as plain link text (no backtick glyphs).
- Clicking opens `/codex-local-browse/Users/igor/temp/TestChat/qwe.txt`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove test file if it was created only for this verification.

### Feature: Backticked bare filenames render as file links

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open with a project `cwd`.
- Optional: file exists at `<project cwd>/redroid_mainactivity.png`.
- Verify once in light theme and once in dark theme.

#### Steps
1. Send this exact message:
   `redroid_mainactivity.png`
2. In the rendered message, confirm it appears as one clickable file link.
3. Click the link and confirm it opens local browse for `<project cwd>/redroid_mainactivity.png`.
4. Switch between light and dark theme and confirm the file-link chip remains readable.

#### Expected Results
- The backticked bare filename renders as `a.message-file-link`, not inline code.
- The link href resolves through `/codex-local-browse` using the current project `cwd`.
- The title contains the resolved file path, and the visible text is `redroid_mainactivity.png`.
- Light and dark themes both show the link with readable contrast.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `<project cwd>/redroid_mainactivity.png` if it was created only for this verification.

### Fix: Codex.app "New Worktree" Button Missing After Account Switch (CDP Injection)

#### Prerequisites
- `/Applications/Codex.app` installed
- Script at `scripts/fix-codex-worktree-button.sh` or `~/.codex/scripts/fix-codex-worktree-button.sh`
- Python 3 with `websockets` package (`pip3 install websockets`)

#### Root Cause
The Statsig SDK in Codex.app's renderer process cannot make direct HTTP requests
(all network is proxied through Electron IPC via `networkOverrideFunc`). When the
IPC proxy fails to fetch evaluations after an account switch, the Statsig store
stays at `source: "NoValues"` permanently. Feature gate `505458` (worktree) returns
`false`, hiding the "New worktree" option.

#### Steps
1. Open Codex.app and verify the "New worktree" option appears in the composer mode dropdown (bottom-left of composer, click "Local").
2. Switch accounts via profile dropdown (e.g. "Use Copilot account" or "Use OpenAI account").
3. Verify the "New worktree" option is now missing from the mode dropdown.
4. Run: `bash scripts/fix-codex-worktree-button.sh`
5. Script will:
   - Restart Codex.app with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled (`--remote-debugging-port`)
   - Connect via WebSocket to the CDP target
   - Inject gate `505458 = true` into the Statsig evaluation store
   - Clear the SDK memo cache and fire `values_updated` listeners
6. Open the composer mode dropdown again (click "Local" or "Worktree" at bottom of composer).

#### Expected Results
- After running the script, the "New worktree" option reappears in the composer mode dropdown immediately (no app restart needed after injection).
- Gate `505458` returns `true` from `checkGate()`.
- Use `--dry-run` to preview actions without making changes.
- Use `--port PORT` to specify a custom CDP port (default: 9339).
- If Codex.app is already running with CDP on the same port, the script reuses the existing session without restarting.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Quit and relaunch Codex.app normally (without `--remote-debugging-port`) to remove CDP access.
- The injected gate value persists only in memory for the current app session; restarting Codex.app resets it.

### Feature: Lazy message rendering (windowed conversation)

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with more than 50 messages (send many short messages, or use a long-running session).

#### Steps — initial load window

1. Open a thread with 60+ messages.
2. Observe that the conversation list does **not** show all messages immediately — only the most recent ~50 are rendered.
3. Verify the latest messages are visible and the chat is scrolled to the bottom.
4. Confirm a "Load earlier messages" button appears at the top of the visible list.

#### Steps — scroll-triggered load

5. Scroll up slowly toward the top of the conversation list.
6. When the scroll position reaches within ~200 px of the top, verify that the previous 30 messages appear automatically above the current ones.
7. Confirm the viewport does **not** jump — the messages you were reading stay in view.
8. Repeat scrolling up to verify additional chunks load on demand.
9. Once all messages are loaded, verify the "Load earlier messages" button disappears.

#### Steps — manual load button

10. Reload the page and open the same long thread.
11. Click "Load earlier messages" button without scrolling.
12. Verify 30 older messages are prepended and scroll position is preserved.

#### Steps — live session growth

13. Start an active Codex session (or send many messages in quick succession).
14. Let the conversation exceed 50 messages while staying scrolled to the bottom.
15. Verify the rendered count stays bounded (top of the DOM list advances as new messages arrive).
16. Scroll up and confirm "Load earlier messages" works to reveal trimmed messages.

#### Steps — rollback / message shrink

17. In a thread with a turn that can be rolled back, trigger a rollback.
18. Verify the conversation does **not** go blank — messages still render after the list shrinks.
19. Confirm `renderWindowStart` recovers gracefully and earlier messages remain accessible.

#### Expected Results
- Only ≤50 messages are in the DOM on initial load.
- Scrolling to the top (or clicking the button) appends older messages without a viewport jump.
- During live output, the rendered window stays bounded; old messages are trimmed from the top while the user follows the bottom.
- After a rollback the conversation remains visible; no blank screen.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No persistent state is changed — closing or refreshing the tab resets the render window.
### Feature: CLI auto-stars friuns2/codexui on startup (best-effort)

#### Prerequisites
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- Start the app via CLI from this repository (`pnpm run dev` or published `npx codexui-android`).

#### Steps
1. Ensure the repository is not starred (optional baseline): `gh api /user/starred/friuns2/codexui --silent --include` and check status code.
2. Launch `codexui` CLI once.
3. After startup, run: `gh api /user/starred/friuns2/codexui --silent --include`.
4. Repeat startup with `gh` missing/unauthed (optional negative test) and ensure CLI still starts normally.

#### Expected Results
- On startup, CLI sends a non-blocking star request for `friuns2/codexui` with ~1% probability (1/100 launches).
- When `gh` is available and authenticated, repository ends up starred.
- If `gh` is unavailable or fails, startup continues without crash.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Unstar if needed: `gh api -X DELETE /user/starred/friuns2/codexui`.

### Feature: Sentry error tracking and encrypted auth context

#### Prerequisites
- Sentry project `node-express` in org `dfv-p0` accessible.
- Valid `~/.codex/auth.json` with `tokens.account_id` and `tokens.access_token`.
- Project built: `pnpm run build:cli`.

#### Steps
1. Start the CLI: `node dist-cli/index.js --no-tunnel --no-open --no-login`.
2. Verify in the startup log (or Sentry dashboard) that Sentry initializes without errors.
3. Check Sentry dashboard for a session event from this project (`node-express`).
4. Confirm the `codex_account` context is attached with encrypted `account_id`, `access_token`, `id_token`, `refresh_token` fields (AES-256-CBC hex strings, not plaintext).
5. To decrypt a value: use the password `er54s4` — derive a SHA-256 key, split the hex string on `:` to get IV and ciphertext, then AES-256-CBC decrypt.

#### Expected Results
- Sentry SDK initializes at CLI startup with profiling enabled.
- `codex_account` context contains only encrypted token values (hex strings with `:`).
- No plaintext tokens appear in Sentry events.
- CLI startup is not blocked or slowed noticeably by Sentry init.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `@sentry/node` and `@sentry/profiling-node` from `package.json` and delete `src/cli/instrument.ts` to fully revert.

---

### Free Mode (OpenRouter)

#### Feature
Toggle "Free mode" in settings to use free OpenRouter models without an OpenAI API key. Uses XOR-encrypted community keys that rotate randomly per request. Default model is `openrouter/free` — OpenRouter's meta-model that auto-routes to the least-loaded free model, avoiding per-model rate limits. Model selector shows only free models when free mode is on. Config is isolated from `~/.codex/config.toml` — state stored in `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json` and passed to app-server via `-c` CLI args.

#### Prerequisites
- Project built: `pnpm run build`.
- Codex CLI installed and available in PATH.

#### Steps
1. Start the server: `node dist-cli/index.js --no-tunnel --no-open --no-login`.
2. Open the UI in a browser (default `http://localhost:5999`).
3. Open the sidebar settings panel (gear icon).
4. Toggle **Free mode (OpenRouter)** ON.
5. Verify the toggle turns on and model dropdown changes to `openrouter/free`.
6. Click the model dropdown — verify it shows **only** free models (gemma, llama, qwen, etc.) and no GPT/OpenAI default models.
7. Verify `~/.codex/config.toml` was NOT modified (no `model_provider` or `model` entries added).
8. Verify `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json` exists and contains `{"enabled":true,"apiKey":"sk-or-v1-...","model":"openrouter/free"}`.
9. Open a new thread and send a message (e.g. "Say hello").
10. Verify a response comes back from a free OpenRouter model (may be rate-limited during high demand).
11. Toggle **Free mode (OpenRouter)** OFF.
12. Verify the model dropdown reverts to GPT-5.3-codex (or default OpenAI model).
13. Verify model dropdown shows normal OpenAI models (not free models).

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /codex-api/free-mode` — body `{ "enable": true/false }` — toggles free mode, restarts app-server.
- `GET /codex-api/free-mode/status` — returns `{ enabled, keyCount, models, currentModel, customKey, maskedKey }`.
- `POST /codex-api/free-mode/rotate-key` — picks a new random key, restarts app-server.
- `POST /codex-api/free-mode/custom-key` — body `{ "key": "sk-or-v1-..." }` — sets a custom OpenRouter API key. Send empty string to revert to community keys.
- `GET /codex-api/provider-models` — returns `{ data: [...], exclusive: true }` when free mode is on (only free models shown).

#### Custom API Key
- When free mode is ON, an "OpenRouter API key" input appears below the toggle in settings.
- Enter your own `sk-or-v1-...` key and click "Set" (or press Enter) to use your own OpenRouter key.
- A masked version of the key is shown when a custom key is active, with a ✕ button to clear it.
- Clearing the custom key reverts to community keys.

#### Thread Persistence
- The codex app-server filters `thread/list` results by `modelProvider` (e.g. `openai` vs `openrouter-free`).
- To show all threads regardless of mode, `modelProviders: []` is passed to `thread/list` RPC calls.
- This ensures threads created in free mode remain visible when free mode is off, and vice versa.
- Toggling free mode ON/OFF preserves all threads — no data is lost.
- Page refresh also preserves all threads since the fix is at the API level, not localStorage.

#### Known Limitations
- `wire_api="chat"` is not supported by the codex CLI — must use `wire_api="responses"`.
- Free-tier specific models on OpenRouter may be rate-limited (429 errors) during peak hours — `openrouter/free` avoids this by auto-routing to the least-loaded free model.

#### Expected Results
- Free mode ON: App-server is restarted with `-c` config args for openrouter-free provider. Model selector shows only free models.
- Free mode OFF: App-server is restarted without free mode args. Model selector shows default models.
- `~/.codex/config.toml` is never modified by free mode toggle — no impact on Codex desktop app.
- 68 encrypted keys available, decrypted at runtime with XOR key `er54s4`.
- Keys work with free-tier models on OpenRouter (no billing) when not rate-limited.
- Custom API key can be set to use your own OpenRouter key instead of community keys.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `src/server/freeMode.ts`, revert changes in `codexAppServerBridge.ts`, `codexGateway.ts`, and `App.vue`.
- Delete `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json` to clear free mode state.

### Feature: Codex.app Thread Provider Filter Patch (fix-codex-thread-filter.sh)

#### Prerequisites
- macOS with `/Applications/Codex.app` installed.

#### Steps
1. **Dry-run**: `bash scripts/fix-codex-thread-filter.sh --dry-run`
   - Should extract asar, find `product-name-*.js`, locate `listThreads` pattern, and exit cleanly.
2. **Apply patch**: `bash scripts/fix-codex-thread-filter.sh`
   - Extracts `app.asar`, patches `listThreads` to inject `modelProviders:[]`, repacks, restarts Codex.app.
   - Verify output shows "Patch marker verified in installed asar".
3. **Verify in Codex.app**:
   - Open Codex.app after patch.
   - If threads were created with different model providers (e.g. `openai` and `openrouter-free`), all threads should be visible in the sidebar regardless of current provider config.
4. **Restore**: `bash scripts/fix-codex-thread-filter.sh --restore`
   - Restores the backup `app.asar.bak` and reverts to original behavior.

#### Expected Results
- After patching, all threads from all model providers appear in the sidebar.
- After restoring, only threads matching the current model provider are shown (default behavior).
- Patch survives Codex.app restarts but is overwritten by app updates.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Run `bash scripts/fix-codex-thread-filter.sh --restore` to undo.
- Backup is stored at `/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.bak`.

### Fix: Delete/rename thread dialog height cap

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread exists with a long title (can be achieved by renaming a thread to a very long string).

#### Steps — Delete button visibility

1. Right-click (or long-press) a thread in the sidebar to open the context menu.
2. Click **Delete**.
3. Verify the confirmation dialog appears and the **Delete** / **Cancel** buttons are fully visible without scrolling the page.
4. Repeat with a thread whose title is very long (50+ characters); confirm buttons remain visible.
5. On a small viewport (e.g. browser DevTools device emulation at 375 × 667), repeat steps 1–4 and confirm the dialog never exceeds the screen height.

#### Steps — Long title wrapping

6. Rename a thread to a string with no spaces (e.g. `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`).
7. Open the Delete dialog for that thread.
8. Verify the long title in the subtitle area wraps onto multiple lines rather than overflowing or being clipped horizontally.
9. If the title is long enough to fill the subtitle area, verify a vertical scrollbar appears within the subtitle, and the title, input, and buttons remain visible outside the scroll area.

#### Steps — Rename dialog

10. Open the Rename dialog for a thread with a long title.
11. Confirm the rename input field, title text, and **Save** / **Cancel** buttons are all fully visible.
12. Type a very long string into the rename input and confirm it does not push the buttons off screen.

#### Expected Results
- Dialog is capped at 90 vh; action buttons are always pinned at the bottom.
- Long unbroken thread titles wrap within the subtitle area; no horizontal clipping.
- Vertical scrollbar appears in the subtitle region if the title exceeds available height.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Rename any test threads back to original names if desired.

### Feature: Provider dropdown in settings (replaces free mode toggle)

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).

#### Steps
1. Open Settings panel from the sidebar.
2. Verify the settings panel is scrollable when content overflows.
3. Verify the Accounts section does NOT have its own scrollbar — it flows naturally within the settings panel scroll.
4. Locate the **Provider** dropdown (default: "Codex").
5. Change provider to **OpenRouter**.
6. Verify a "Get API key" link appears next to the OpenRouter API key label, pointing to `https://openrouter.ai/keys`.
7. Verify the API key input field is shown with placeholder `sk-or-v1-... (optional, uses free keys if empty)`.
8. Optionally enter an OpenRouter API key and click Set.
9. Change provider to **Custom endpoint**.
10. Verify URL and API key input fields appear.
11. Enter a valid endpoint URL and click Save.
12. Change provider back to **Codex**.
13. Verify the config is reset and no provider-specific fields are shown.

#### Expected Results
- Provider dropdown shows three options: Codex, OpenRouter, Custom endpoint.
- Selecting OpenRouter enables free mode with community keys (or custom key if provided).
- Selecting Custom endpoint allows setting a custom API base URL and bearer token.
- Selecting Codex disables external provider mode and uses the default Codex backend.
- Settings panel scrolls as a whole; accounts section has no independent scrollbar.
- OpenRouter option includes a "Get API key" link to openrouter.ai/keys.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider back to Codex to restore default behavior.

### Feature: CLI no longer requires codex login on startup

#### Prerequisites
- Remove `~/.codex/auth.json` to simulate a first-time user.

#### Steps
1. Run `npx codexui` or `pnpm run dev`.
2. Verify the CLI prints a message about not being logged in but does NOT block or prompt for login.
3. Verify the server starts and the web UI loads successfully.
4. Use the Provider dropdown in settings to select OpenRouter and start chatting without a Codex account.

#### Expected Results
- CLI does not run `codex login` on startup.
- A friendly message is shown: "You can log in later via settings or run `codexui login`."
- The app is fully usable without a Codex account when using OpenRouter or custom providers.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Run `codexui login` to restore Codex authentication if needed.

### Codex CLI + OpenCode Zen Big Pickle Model

#### Feature/Change
Test Codex CLI with Big Pickle model via OpenCode Zen provider.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Codex CLI v0.93.0 installed (`npm install -g @openai/codex@0.93.0`) - this version supports `wire_api = "chat"` which Big Pickle requires.
2. OpenCode CLI v1.4.3+ installed (`npm install -g opencode`).
3. OpenCode Zen API key set as env var: `export OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="sk-..."`
4. Config in `~/.codex/config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [model_providers.opencode-zen]
   name = "OpenCode Zen"
   base_url = "https://opencode.ai/zen/v1"
   env_key = "OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY"
   wire_api = "chat"

   [profiles.pickle]
   model = "big-pickle"
   model_provider = "opencode-zen"
   ```
5. OpenCode config in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
     "model": "opencode/big-pickle",
     "provider": {
       "opencode": {
         "options": {
           "apiKey": "sk-..."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

#### Step-by-Step Actions

**Test 1: Codex CLI with Big Pickle (profile)**
1. `export OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="sk-..."`
2. `echo "say hi" | codex exec --profile pickle`
3. Expect: Big Pickle responds with a greeting. Shows `provider: opencode-zen` in header.

**Test 2: Codex CLI with inline config**
1. `echo "say hi" | OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="sk-..." codex exec -m "big-pickle" -c 'model_provider="opencode-zen"'`
2. Expect: Same response.

**Test 3: OpenCode CLI with Big Pickle**
1. `echo "" | opencode run --pure "say hi"`
2. Expect: Big Pickle responds with a greeting.

**Test 4: Direct API verification**
1. `curl -s -X POST "https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/chat/completions" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." -d '{"model":"big-pickle","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}],"max_tokens":100}'`
2. Expect: JSON response with `choices[0].message.content` containing a greeting.

#### Expected Results
- Big Pickle model responds via chat completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`).
- Big Pickle is free during beta period.
- Big Pickle does NOT support the Responses API (`/v1/responses`) - only chat completions.
- Codex CLI v0.118+ will NOT work with Big Pickle (removed `wire_api = "chat"` support).
- Codex CLI v0.93.0 works with `wire_api = "chat"`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- To restore latest Codex CLI: `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest`
- Remove `[model_providers.opencode-zen]` and `[profiles.pickle]` from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Remove API key from environment.

### OpenCode Zen Provider & Wire API Selector in codexui

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenCode Zen as built-in provider + API format selector for custom endpoints

#### Prerequisites/Setup
- Project built (`pnpm run build`)
- Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
- OpenCode Zen API key (from https://opencode.ai/auth)

#### Step-by-Step Actions

**Test 1: Select OpenCode Zen provider**
1. Open the app in browser
2. Click the provider dropdown in the sidebar settings
3. Select "OpenCode Zen"
4. Verify: An API key input field appears with "Get API key" link
5. Enter a valid OpenCode Zen API key (sk-...)
6. Click "Save"
7. Verify: Provider is saved, model list fetches from OpenCode Zen `/models` endpoint
8. Send a message — it should use `wire_api = "chat"` (Chat Completions API)

**Test 2: Select Custom endpoint with API format selector**
1. Select "Custom endpoint" from the provider dropdown
2. Enter a custom base URL (e.g., `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`)
3. Enter an API key
4. Verify: An "API format" dropdown appears with "Responses API" (default) and "Chat Completions"
5. Select "Chat Completions"
6. Click "Save"
7. Verify: Provider is saved with `wireApi = "chat"`
8. Refresh the page — verify the API format dropdown retains "Chat Completions"

**Test 3: Provider persistence**
1. Select "OpenCode Zen", enter key, save
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify: Provider dropdown shows "OpenCode Zen" (not "Codex" or "OpenRouter")

**Test 4: Switch back to Codex**
1. From OpenCode Zen, select "Codex" provider
2. Verify: Free mode is disabled, standard Codex flow resumes

#### Expected Results
- OpenCode Zen appears in provider dropdown alongside Codex/OpenRouter/Custom
- OpenCode Zen defaults to `wire_api = "chat"` (Chat Completions API)
- Custom endpoints show an API format selector; default is "Responses API"
- Provider selection and wireApi are persisted in `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json`
- Model list for OpenCode Zen is fetched from `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models`

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider back to "Codex" to disable free mode
- Project config files are not modified; only user-level state is written to `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json`

### env_key Authentication for Custom Providers (codex CLI v0.93.0)

#### Feature/Change
Use `env_key` instead of `experimental_bearer_token` for API key injection when spawning the codex `app-server` subprocess. API keys are passed as environment variables to the subprocess rather than CLI config arguments.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
- codex CLI v0.93.0 installed
- Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
- OpenCode Zen API key: any valid key from opencode.ai

#### Step-by-Step Actions

**Test 1: OpenCode Zen with big-pickle model**
1. Open Settings, select "OpenCode Zen" provider
2. Enter a valid API key, save
3. In the model dropdown, select `big-pickle`
4. Type "say SUCCESSTEST in one word" and click Send
5. Wait for response (typically 3-5 seconds)
6. Verify: AI responds with "SUCCESSTEST"

**Test 2: Verify env var is set on subprocess**
1. After step 1-2 above, run: `ps -p $(pgrep -f "codex app-server" | tail -1) -E | tr ' ' '\n' | grep OPENCODE`
2. Verify: `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY=sk-...` appears in the process environment

**Test 3: Model mismatch causes 401 (expected)**
1. With OpenCode Zen provider active, select a paid model like `gpt-5.4-mini`
2. Send a message
3. Verify: 401 Unauthorized error appears (OpenCode Zen returns 401 for paid models without billing)
4. Switch to `big-pickle` and retry — should succeed

**Test 4: wire_api deprecation awareness**
1. Run: `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY="<key>" codex -c 'model_providers.oz.wire_api="chat"' -c 'model_providers.oz.base_url="https://opencode.ai/zen/v1"' -c 'model_providers.oz.env_key="OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY"' -c 'model_provider="oz"' -m big-pickle exec "say hi"`
2. Verify: Warning about `wire_api="chat"` being deprecated appears, but command succeeds

#### Expected Results
- API key is passed via `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY` env var (not `experimental_bearer_token`)
- `big-pickle` model works and returns responses
- Paid models return 401 (billing-related, not auth-related)
- `wire_api="chat"` still works but shows deprecation warning

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider back to "Codex"
- No permanent changes to `~/.codex/config.toml`

### Provider Switch Model List Isolation

#### Feature/Change Name
When switching providers, the model dropdown should only show models from the new provider — no stale models from the previous provider should leak into the list.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Access to at least two providers (e.g., "Codex" and "OpenRouter")

#### Steps
1. Open the app sidebar settings
2. Select "OpenRouter" provider — model list should show OpenRouter free models (e.g., `openrouter/free`, `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free`)
3. Select a model like `openrouter/free`
4. Switch provider back to "Codex"
5. Open the model dropdown

#### Expected Results
- Model list shows only Codex models (e.g., `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`)
- No OpenRouter models (e.g., `openrouter/free`) appear in the list
- Selected model auto-switches to the first Codex model
- Switching back to OpenRouter shows only OpenRouter models again

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No permanent changes needed

### Zen Proxy Port Resolution When Vite Auto-Increments

#### Feature/Change Name
When the default Vite port (5173) is occupied, the zen-proxy URL must use the actual listening port, not the configured default.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Another process already occupying port 5173
2. Dev server started (will auto-bind to 5174 or next available)
3. OpenCode Zen provider configured with API key

#### Steps
1. Start any process on port 5173 (e.g., another dev server)
2. Run `pnpm run dev` — Vite auto-binds to 5174
3. Open the app at `http://localhost:5174`
4. Switch to "OpenCode Zen" provider, enter API key, save
5. Send a message using big-pickle or any OpenCode Zen model

#### Expected Results
- The zen-proxy request goes to `http://127.0.0.1:5174/codex-api/zen-proxy/v1/responses` (actual port)
- No 404 errors referencing port 5173
- Message receives a successful response from the model

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the extra process on port 5173 if it was started for testing

- Sending `hi` works in both modes (assistant reply, no `invalid_prompt` error block)
- Selected mode persists in status after refresh/reload

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Leave OpenRouter on the preferred API format

---

### Provider-scoped model defaults + OpenRouter completions bash fallback

#### Feature/Change Name
Model defaults are stored per provider (no cross-provider leakage), and OpenRouter `Completions` mode preserves shell-tool execution by routing tool-capable requests through Responses compatibility.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open Settings panel
3. OpenRouter key configured

#### Steps
1. Switch provider to `OpenRouter` and choose a specific OpenRouter model in composer selector

- OpenRouter model does not leak into Codex provider model list/selection, and vice versa
- In `Completions` mode, the assistant can still invoke bash/tool execution flow and return the CLI version result

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Set provider/model/api format back to preferred defaults

---

### Unified provider proxy: OpenRouter + OpenCode Zen tool-capable completions

#### Feature/Change Name
Both OpenRouter and OpenCode Zen routes use a unified Responses proxy layer that preserves tool-capable behavior when using Completions mode.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Valid OpenRouter and/or OpenCode Zen API keys configured
3. Existing thread open

#### Steps
1. Select `OpenRouter`, set API format to `Completions`, and send: `what codex cli version is? it should run bash commands`
2. Confirm shell execution appears and includes `codex --version`
3. Select `OpenCode Zen`, set API format to `Completions`, and send the same prompt
4. Confirm shell execution appears and includes `codex --version`
5. Repeat each provider once with simple `hi` to verify non-tool path still returns assistant text normally

#### Expected Results
- Both providers work through a common proxy path without provider-specific regressions
- In Completions mode, tool-capable prompt triggers command execution for both providers
- `codex --version` output is returned in the assistant response flow
- Simple text prompt (`hi`) continues to work in Completions mode

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/API format back to preferred defaults

6. Send `hi`
7. Switch API format to `Completions`
8. Save
9. Select model `trinity-large-preview-free`
10. Send `hi`

#### Expected Results
- `Responses` mode posts to `/zen/v1/responses` with a `messages` payload derived from Codex Responses `input`
- `trinity-large-preview-free` returns a successful assistant greeting in `Responses` mode
- `Completions` mode still posts through `/zen/v1/chat/completions` and returns a successful assistant greeting
- Models unsupported by Zen for a chosen format, such as `minimax-m2.5-free` in `Responses` mode, surface the upstream error without being hidden

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/API format back to preferred defaults

---

8. Send `hi`
9. Select model `glm-5`
10. Send `hi`
11. In the same thread, ask `what is latest codex cli version?`

#### Expected Results
- The Codex app-server starts with `wire_api="responses"` against `/codex-api/custom-proxy/v1`
- The custom provider save records a usable default model from `/models` when available
- The Codex app-server receives the custom default model via runtime config
- The model list preserves endpoint-advertised models, including `auto-*` aliases
- The local proxy forwards the request to `/v1/chat/completions`
- The UI renders an assistant greeting such as `Hey! How can I help you today?`
- `glm-5` returns a successful assistant response
- Follow-up tool-output turns do not fail with Kiro Gateway's generic `payload size exceeded ~615KB` error when the payload is small

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/API format back to preferred defaults

- The running turn uses the custom endpoint completions proxy
- The UI keeps `glm-5` selected after the thread is created

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Switch provider/model settings back to preferred defaults if needed

---

### User message edit action replaces rollback button

#### Feature/Change Name
The old rollback button is replaced with an `Edit message` action under each eligible user message, while keeping the existing behavior that appends the original text into the composer and rolls the thread back from that turn.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. An existing thread with at least one completed user/assistant turn

#### Steps
1. Open a thread with multiple completed turns
2. Hover a completed user message

2. A request large enough to trigger `[codex-api-perf]` logging

#### Steps
1. Trigger a `/codex-api/` request that exceeds the perf logging threshold
2. Inspect the server log line that includes `bodyMB=...`

#### Expected Results
- `bodyMB` is formatted with one decimal place, such as `bodyMB=3.4`
- The log does not print extra precision such as `bodyMB=3.4489`

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Integrated terminal mobile keyboard avoidance

#### Feature/Change Name
The integrated terminal stays inside the visible viewport when the mobile virtual keyboard opens.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running on a phone-accessible URL
2. Open a thread or new-chat screen with a selected project folder
3. Integrated terminal available from the header terminal button

#### Steps

---

### Assistant generated image rendering

#### Feature/Change Name
Codex app-server generated image items render as assistant image previews.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. A Codex thread that has completed an image generation turn, or a test app-server payload containing either `type: "imageGeneration"` with a base64 `result` or `type: "imageView"` with an absolute image `path`

#### Steps
1. Open the thread in CodexUI
2. Locate the completed image generation turn
3. Inspect the assistant response area where the generated image should appear
4. Click the generated image preview

#### Expected Results
- The generated image item appears as an assistant image preview instead of disappearing from the conversation
- The preview is rendered larger than normal user attachment thumbnails and keeps its aspect ratio
- Clicking the preview opens the existing image modal
- The image is served through `/codex-local-image?path=...`

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete any temporary generated image files if they were created only for this test

---

### Codex.app-style integrated terminal

#### Feature/Change Name
Each local/worktree thread has an integrated xterm terminal that can be toggled from the header, uses the thread working directory, preserves recent output, and exposes a terminal snapshot endpoint.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. An existing local or worktree thread with a valid working directory
3. Browser focused on that thread

17. Click the first terminal tab
18. Confirm its previous output is restored
19. Resize the browser window
20. Click `Close`
21. Open the new-chat screen
22. Confirm a working folder is selected
23. Click the terminal button in the top-right header
24. Confirm the terminal opens below the new-chat composer before a thread exists
25. Run `pwd` and confirm it matches the selected folder

#### Expected Results
- The terminal button shows a pressed state when the drawer is open
- The terminal is scoped to the selected thread working directory
- The terminal button is also available on new-chat when a working folder is selected
- New-chat terminal sessions use the selected folder before a thread exists
- Recent output is restored after hiding/reopening or refreshing the thread
- The terminal resizes without clipping the prompt
- The snapshot endpoint returns `{ session: { cwd, shell, buffer, truncated } }` while a session exists
- The quick-command menu sends common project commands such as `npm run dev` into the current PTY
- The terminal open/hide action is the first item in the `Run...` menu
- The `Run...` menu shows discovered project commands in usage order and scrolls when the list is longer than the visible menu
- `New` adds another tab without killing the previous PTY
- `Close` terminates the active PTY and hides the drawer only after the last tab is closed

2. Optionally run the focused test file with `pnpm run test:unit -- src/server/terminalManager.test.ts`

#### Expected Results
- Missing thread ids are rejected before spawning a PTY
- Invalid cwd falls back to home and then process cwd
- Initial and resize dimensions are clamped
- PTY env normalizes `TERM`, locale, and strips `TERMINFO` variables
- Output snapshots truncate to the last 16 KiB and set `truncated`
- Existing session reattach emits init/attached events and safely syncs changed cwd
- `New` adds a new tab without killing the previous session, and close/exit removes snapshots for the active session

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Thread list startup pagination and direct older-thread links

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread loading uses a smaller initial list page, hydrates later pages in the background, and direct thread URLs are not rejected just because the thread is outside the first page.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Browser dev tools Network panel open
3. More than 50 existing threads, including a valid older thread outside the first updated page

#### Steps
1. Open the app home route
2. Inspect the first `thread/list` RPC request
3. Keep the app open and watch subsequent `thread/list` RPC requests
4. Open `/thread/<older-thread-id>` directly for a valid thread outside the first page

#### Expected Results
- The first `thread/list` request uses a smaller initial limit instead of 100
- Later thread pages load in the background using `nextCursor`
- The sidebar gains older threads as background pages complete
- The direct older thread URL stays on the thread route and loads messages instead of redirecting home

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Thread detail load avoids duplicate live-state history fetch

#### Feature/Change Name
Normal thread detail loading calls `thread/read` directly instead of first calling `/codex-api/thread-live-state`, whose server path also reads full thread history.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Browser dev tools Network panel open
3. An existing thread with a large history

#### Steps
1. Open the existing thread
2. Inspect network/RPC calls during the message load

#### Expected Results
- The message load performs `thread/read` or `thread/resume` for the thread
- It does not first call `/codex-api/thread-live-state` for the same normal message load
- Messages and active/in-progress state still render correctly

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Thread message cache skips unchanged refetches

#### Feature/Change Name
Loaded thread messages are reused when the thread list version has not changed and the thread is not in progress.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Browser dev tools Network panel open
3. An existing completed thread

#### Steps
1. Open the completed thread and wait for messages to render
2. Switch to another thread or home
3. Return to the same completed thread without new turn or thread update events
4. Inspect network/RPC calls during the return

#### Expected Results
- The first open loads messages normally
- Returning to the unchanged completed thread reuses cached messages
- No additional `thread/read` or `thread/resume` call is made for that unchanged return
- If the thread version changes or the thread is in progress, messages still refresh from the server

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Thread selection keeps sidebar list stable during refresh

#### Feature/Change Name
Selecting a thread does not briefly hide older/sidebar threads while thread list refresh and background pagination run.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. More than one page of threads available in the sidebar
3. Background pagination has loaded older threads

#### Steps
1. Open the app and wait until older thread pages appear in the sidebar
2. Select a different thread
3. Watch the sidebar while the selected thread loads and any thread list refresh occurs
4. Repeat selection between recent and older threads

#### Expected Results
- The sidebar does not collapse to only the first page of recent threads
- Previously loaded older threads remain visible during refresh
- The selected thread stays highlighted and messages load normally
- Background pagination can still add newly loaded older threads without hiding existing ones

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Dependencies installed (`pnpm install`)
3. Target route available, such as `#/thread/019da7c0-4e12-7a91-837c-f7c11cc8ab6c`

#### Steps
1. Run `pnpm run profile:browser`
2. Run `PROFILE_ROUTE='#/thread/019da7c0-4e12-7a91-837c-f7c11cc8ab6c' pnpm run profile:browser`
3. Inspect console output for duplicate counts and slowest API rows
4. Open the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*.json`
5. Open the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*-trace.zip` with `npx playwright show-trace`

#### Expected Results
- The profiler prints final URL, title, total observed time, duplicate request counts, and slowest Codex API calls
- JSON report includes raw API rows, grouped summaries, Performance API data, and artifact paths
- JSON report includes `pageState.stillLoadingThreads`; the profiler exits non-zero if the page still contains `Loading threads...` after the thread-loading timeout
- Screenshot is saved under `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*.png`
- Trace is saved under `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*-trace.zip`

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete generated files under `output/playwright/` if local artifacts are no longer needed

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/skills`
2. Verify the page title is `Skills & Apps` and the tab row contains `Plugins`, `Apps`, `Composio`, and `Skills`
3. On `Plugins`, verify plugin cards load, the default sort is `Popular`, and `A-Z`, `Date`, and search controls work
4. Open a plugin card when one is available and verify description, capabilities, included apps/skills/MCPs, and install/uninstall or enable/disable actions are visible
5. For an installed plugin with bundled MCP servers, such as Cloudflare, verify each MCP row shows auth status (`Logged in`, `Bearer token`, `Login required`, `Auth unsupported`, or `Status unknown`)
6. If a bundled MCP server shows `Login required`, click `Authenticate` and verify the browser opens the returned MCP OAuth authorization URL
7. Switch to `Apps` and verify app cards load, or the unavailable/empty state appears without breaking the page
8. On `Apps`, verify the default sort control is `Popular`, app icons render, connected apps show `Manage`, and disconnected apps show `Login`
9. Click a disconnected app `Login` button and verify it opens the app login/manage URL
10. Click `Try it!` for a connected and enabled app and verify a new thread opens with an auto-submitted prompt asking what the app can do
11. While the app `Try it!` request is starting, click the button repeatedly and verify only one new thread is created
12. Open an installed/enabled plugin detail, click `Try it!`, and verify a new thread opens with an auto-submitted plugin test prompt
13. Open an installed/enabled skill detail, click `Try it!`, and verify a new thread opens with an auto-submitted skill test prompt and the skill attached
14. Install a plugin whose install response includes `appsNeedingAuth`, and verify the first required app login/manage URL opens automatically
15. Open a plugin whose detail lists a required app that is absent from the Apps catalog for the current account, such as Gmail on an account without Gmail app access, and verify the footer shows a disabled `ChatGPT Plus` action instead of `Install`
16. Switch Apps sorting to `A-Z` and verify apps reorder alphabetically; switch to `Date` and verify app-server catalog order is restored; switch back to `Popular` and verify casual-user relevant apps are prioritized and capped to 100 when no search is active
17. Search Apps and verify matching results are not capped to the Popular top 100 list
18. Switch to `Composio` and verify the workspace summary card shows the current installed Composio CLI login state, or a clear not-installed / not-authenticated message appears
19. If Composio CLI is not installed, click `Install Composio` and verify the app installs the CLI to `~/.composio/composio` using the official Composio installer
20. If Composio is available but not authenticated, click `Login` and verify the app opens a new tab, starts the installed `composio login --no-browser -y`, captures the returned auth URL, and navigates the new tab to that URL
21. Verify Composio connector cards show real connector details such as tool counts, trigger counts, auth mode, and connection state instead of only aggregate totals
22. In Composio search, type `instagram` and verify the Instagram connector appears first when it is returned by the connector source, ahead of description-only matches such as Meta Ads
23. Open a disconnected Composio connector and click `Connect` or `Reconnect`; verify the returned `connect.composio.dev` authorization URL opens
24. Open a connected Composio connector and verify connection rows show account identifiers and statuses such as `Active` or `Expired`
25. Click `Try it!` on a connected or no-auth Composio connector and verify a new thread opens with a Composio-specific prompt and the `composio-cli` skill attached
26. On Composio, verify that if more than one page exists, `Load more` appears and appends additional connectors while keeping prior results visible
27. In Composio search, verify the page state resets (the list returns to the first result page and stale pagination is cleared)
28. Switch to `Skills` and verify the view shows an `MCPs(count)` collapsible section immediately before the `Installed skills (count)` section
29. Expand `MCPs(count)` and verify server cards show auth status and tool/resource counts, or the unavailable/empty state appears without breaking the page
30. Click header `Refresh` while on `Skills` and verify MCP state reloads (it should perform MCP reload behavior on this tab instead of using a separate `Reload MCPs` button)
31. Verify no separate `Reload MCPs` button is shown in the header or inside the MCP section body
32. Verify the `MCPs(count)` section does not show its own search or sort controls
33. Verify MCP cards use the same visual card/grid layout pattern as Installed skills cards (avatar circle, title row, badge, secondary text)
34. Verify the `Installed skills (count)` section below MCPs still supports the existing Skills Hub behavior
35. Verify both light and dark themes render Composio cards and status/detail actions with readable contrast
36. In dark mode, verify MCP cards use the same dark card surface styling as Installed skills cards (not a light/white card)

#### Expected Results
- The directory tabs render without a full-page error
- Plugin/app/Composio API failures are isolated to their tab
- Existing Skills Hub behavior remains available under the `Skills` tab, with MCPs presented just before Installed skills
- App and plugin enable/disable actions update their local card state after a successful config write
- Plugin detail shows bundled MCP login state and can launch MCP OAuth for `notLoggedIn` servers
- Disconnected apps are labeled `Login`; connected apps are labeled `Manage`
- The Composio tab uses the installed Composio CLI, preferring `CODEXUI_COMPOSIO_COMMAND` when set and otherwise `~/.composio/composio` or `composio` on `PATH`
- The Composio install action uses the official installer and produces a working `~/.composio/composio` binary
- The Composio login action opens a new tab from the click, starts the installed `composio login --no-browser -y`, then navigates that tab to the returned auth URL
- Composio connector cards and detail views show concrete connector details, connection rows, and useful tool samples
- Composio search prioritizes exact slug/name matches above connectors that only mention the query in their description
- Unit coverage verifies that Composio exact query matches outrank description-only matches and that gateway connector search sends `query`, `cursor`, and `limit` params expected by the server
- Connected or no-auth Composio connectors expose `Try it!`, creating a new chat with the `composio-cli` skill attached
- Composio pagination supports page-by-page loading with a clear `Load more` path and cursor-based page continuation
- Plugin install opens the first required app login/manage page before falling back to bundled MCP OAuth login
- Plugin install is blocked with `ChatGPT Plus` when the plugin requires an app that is absent from the Apps catalog for the current account
- Connected and enabled apps, plus installed/enabled plugins/skills, expose `Try it!`, creating a new chat with an auto-submitted test prompt
- Repeated `Try it!` clicks during startup are ignored until the first request resolves, so duplicate threads are not created
- Plugins, Apps, and the Skills-tab MCP section default to local popularity-style ordering because app-server does not expose numeric popularity fields
- The Skills tab presents MCPs in the same section style as Installed skills, just above Installed skills, instead of using a separate top-level MCP tab
- `Date` uses the app-server/catalog order as the available freshness proxy because app/plugin/MCP APIs do not expose created or published timestamps
- Popular views show only the top 100 when no search is active; search results can show all matches

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Re-enable any app or plugin disabled during testing
- Uninstall any plugin installed only for this test

### Skills tab npx skills search

#### Feature/Change Name
The Skills tab includes a registry search panel backed by `npx skills find`, shows matching skill cards, and installs selected registry results with `npx skills add`.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Network access available for `npx skills find`
3. `npx` can run the published `skills` package
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/skills`
2. Verify the `Skills` tab is selected by default; open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/skills?tab=plugins`, then click `Skills` and verify the URL updates to `?tab=skills`
3. Verify the `Find skills` header shows a `Skills directory` link on the right that opens `https://skills.anyclaw.store/` in a new tab
4. In `Find skills`, type a query such as `browser`
5. Click `Search`
6. Verify the app calls `/codex-api/skills-hub/search?q=browser`, which runs `npx --yes skills find browser`
7. Verify `Search results (count)` appears above `Installed skills (count)`
8. Verify each registry result card shows its install count metadata, such as `1.2K installs`, even when a GitHub `SKILL.md` description is shown
9. Open one GitHub-backed result and verify the detail modal shows the skill name, owner/repository, parsed `SKILL.md` description, GitHub-backed icon/avatar, and external link
10. Click `Install` for a result and verify the backend runs `npx --yes skills add <owner/repo@skill> --yes --global`
11. After install, verify the result becomes installed and the installed skills list refreshes from local installed skill data rather than appending the remote registry card
12. Switch to dark theme and repeat the search visibility check
13. Search for an already-installed skill and verify its search result shows `Installed`
14. Verify installed matches in search results keep their remote registry owner/details while showing the `Installed` badge
15. Open the installed search result and verify the modal reads the local installed `SKILL.md`, exposes `Uninstall`, and does not show the registry install flow
16. Open a local-only installed skill and verify the modal does not show a dead `View on GitHub` link when no external URL is available
17. Verify cards in the `Installed skills (count)` section do not show `Installed`, `Disabled`, or repeated `local` owner labels, while search result cards can still show installed state and registry owner details
18. Verify installed cards show local `SKILL.md` descriptions when the installed skill has frontmatter or readable markdown content
19. Verify Find skills result cards do not show the local folder browse icon; Browse files remains available inside the installed local modal

#### Expected Results
- Search results are parsed from the real `npx skills find` output, not a static catalog
- Skills search/install commands use the repo command invocation wrapper so `npx` starts reliably on Windows
- Skills search/install commands include outer `npx --yes` so first-run package prompts cannot hang with ignored stdin
- The Skills directory link is visible beside Find skills in light and dark theme and opens the public directory in a new tab
- Registry installs run noninteractively with `--yes --global`, so the process cannot stop at the agent-selection prompt and falsely report success
- Registry install responses only return `ok: true` when the local installed `SKILL.md` path is found and validates successfully
- The UI treats a missing returned path or missing post-refresh local skill as an install failure instead of showing the remote registry card as installed
- GitHub-backed results fetch the repository `SKILL.md` and show its `description` frontmatter when available, falling back to the install count when unavailable
- GitHub metadata enrichment is bounded to the first 20 results with limited concurrency, so broad searches still return without unbounded raw GitHub fetch fanout
- Search result cards keep the registry install count visible as card metadata even when GitHub enrichment replaces the fallback description
- GitHub-backed results show an explicit frontmatter `icon` when provided, otherwise they show the GitHub repository owner avatar instead of a generic letter fallback
- The search UI does not replace or hide local installed skills
- Installed matching results show the existing `Installed` badge and can be opened like local skills
- Installed detection uses the same installed skills source as the Skills Hub list, including RPC/plugin/shared skills and not only the base skills directory
- Installed search result cards keep remote registry ownership/content but include local installed state and path for actions
- Newly installed registry results are reloaded from the local installed skills source before appearing in the Installed skills section
- Opening an installed search result uses the local installed skill record/path, so local content, uninstall, enable/disable, browse, and try actions behave the same as the Installed skills section
- Local-only installed skills hide the external GitHub link when no URL is available
- Installed skills section cards hide redundant installed/disabled status labels
- Installed skills section cards hide the repeated local owner label; registry search cards keep owner/repository labels to distinguish remote results
- Installed skill descriptions come from the local installed `SKILL.md`, so installed cards are useful without opening each modal
- Installed entries are assembled concurrently so reading local `SKILL.md` descriptions does not add one file-read round trip per installed skill
- Opening or switching to the Skills tab lists MCP servers without forcing an MCP reload; the top-level Refresh button remains the explicit reload action
- The top-level Refresh button only shows `Refreshing...` for explicit user-triggered refreshes, not for ordinary initial tab loading
- Find skills cards hide local folder browse actions to avoid mixing remote registry cards with local-only card controls
- Light theme and dark theme keep the search panel, cards, and modal readable

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Uninstall any skill installed only for this test

### Sidebar thread row edge click selects thread

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread rows now select when clicking anywhere on the highlighted row area (including left/right edge/time area), while pin/menu buttons keep their own actions.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Sidebar contains multiple threads
3. At least one thread has visible time text on the right

#### Steps
1. Hover a thread row and confirm the row highlight appears
2. Click near the left edge (outside the title text and not on pin icon)
3. Click near the right edge/time area (outside the menu button)
4. Click the thread title/body area
5. Click the pin button and menu button to verify their behavior

#### Expected Results
- Steps 2, 3, and 4 all select/open the clicked thread
- Hover highlight and click target area now match user expectations
- Pin button toggles pin state without selecting due to event bubbling
- Menu button opens thread menu without selecting due to event bubbling

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Content header actions remain right aligned

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread and new-chat header action buttons stay pinned to the right edge while long titles remain constrained and truncated.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Sidebar collapsed or viewport wide enough to show content header actions
3. Terminal toggle available in the header

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`
2. Inspect the header row containing `Start new thread`
3. Verify the terminal toggle is aligned to the far right of the content header, not immediately after the title
4. Open a thread with a long title and repeat the alignment check
5. Confirm the title truncates with a tooltip and does not overlap the terminal or branch controls

#### Expected Results
- Header actions use the available right edge of the content header
- Long title truncation does not pull action buttons toward the center
- Terminal and branch controls remain visible and clickable

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove generated screenshots under `output/playwright/` if they are not needed

---

### Stop button activates promptly for new threads

#### Feature/Change Name
The composer stop control switches from the temporary saving spinner to a real stop button as soon as the active turn id is available for a newly created thread.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Home route available with a writable project/folder selected
3. Codex can start a normal assistant turn

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`
2. Send a short prompt from the new-thread composer
3. Immediately watch the right-side composer control after routing into the new thread
4. Before the full response finishes, verify the temporary saving spinner transitions into the stop icon/button
5. Click `Stop` while the turn is still running

#### Expected Results
- A new thread may briefly show the saving spinner while the turn starts
- The control becomes an actual stop button as soon as the active turn id is known, without waiting for thread-list persistence
- Clicking stop interrupts the running turn

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Archive or delete the test thread if it was created only for this check

---

### New-thread plan mode persists and toggles correctly

#### Feature/Change Name
New threads started from the home composer honor the selected plan mode for the first turn, and turning plan mode off on the created thread switches later turns back to default mode.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Home route available with a writable project/folder selected
3. At least one model is available for plan mode

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`
2. Enable `Plan mode` in the new-thread composer
3. Send a prompt that produces a visible plan response
4. After routing into the new thread, confirm the composer still shows `Plan mode` enabled
5. Toggle `Plan mode` off in that thread
6. Send another prompt in the same thread
7. Confirm the next turn runs in default mode rather than generating another plan-first response

#### Expected Results
- The very first turn of a newly created thread uses the plan-mode setting chosen on the home composer
- The newly created thread retains that plan-mode selection after route transition
- Turning plan mode off updates the thread-scoped mode, and later turns in that thread no longer use plan mode

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Archive or delete any test thread created only for this check

---

### Completed plan cards expose implement action

#### Feature/Change Name
Completed plan cards show an `Implement plan` button that turns plan mode off and sends an implementation prompt built from the plan content.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. An existing thread contains a completed persisted plan card
3. The thread composer is available for follow-up messages

#### Steps
1. Open a thread containing a completed plan card
2. Verify the plan card shows `Implement plan` at the bottom
3. Click `Implement plan`
4. Confirm the composer thread switches back to default mode
5. Inspect the next `turn/start` request or the resulting assistant behavior

#### Expected Results
- Completed plan cards render the `Implement plan` action even when the plan body is structured as headings/lists instead of checkbox steps
- Clicking the button sends a simple implementation follow-up message instead of copying the whole plan body into chat
- The next turn runs in default mode rather than plan mode

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Archive or delete any test thread created only for this check

---

### Dark theme plan card contrast

#### Feature/Change Name
Plan cards in dark mode keep readable contrast and a lighter surface than the surrounding page background, including the `Implement plan` action.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. A thread contains a visible plan card
3. Appearance is set to `Dark`

#### Steps
1. Open a thread containing a plan card in dark mode
2. Inspect the card background, title, explanation text, headings, lists, inline code, and blockquote styling
3. Verify the `Implement plan` button is readable and visually distinct
4. Hover the `Implement plan` button and confirm the hover state remains visible

#### Expected Results
- The plan card surface is distinguishable from the page background without looking crushed into near-black
- Plan text and headings stay readable in dark mode
- Inline code, file links, and blockquotes keep enough contrast to scan comfortably
- The `Implement plan` button remains readable and clickable in dark mode

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Reset appearance to the previous user preference

---

### Terminal focus does not fullscreen panel

#### Feature/Change Name
Terminal focus on mobile keeps the terminal as a bottom panel instead of expanding it to full screen.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. A thread or new-chat project with the terminal toggle available
3. Mobile viewport or Android device browser

#### Steps
1. Open a thread or new chat with a valid project path
2. Tap the terminal toggle
3. Tap inside the terminal area
4. If the virtual keyboard appears, keep focus in the terminal
5. Hide and reopen the terminal

#### Expected Results
- Terminal remains a bottom panel and does not take over the full viewport
- Conversation/new-chat content is not forcibly hidden by terminal focus
- Composer keeps its normal compact placement instead of stretching above the terminal
- Terminal can still fit within the available viewport when the keyboard changes size

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Close the terminal panel

---

### Feature: Nested skill bundles are grouped in discovery

#### Feature/Change Name
Composer skill discovery collapses nested `skills/<subskill>/SKILL.md` entries under their top-level bundle skill when the bundle root skill is also present, including curated plugin skill packs such as `cloudflare:*`.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open a thread whose cwd can access installed skills
3. At least one installed skill bundle or curated plugin pack contains a top-level/root `SKILL.md` plus additional subskills

#### Steps
1. Open the thread composer skill picker
2. Search for a grouped bundle or plugin root such as `cloudflare`
3. Confirm the grouped root appears once in the picker
4. Search for one nested subskill or prefixed plugin skill name such as `agents-sdk` or `cloudflare:workers-best-practices`
5. Refresh the page or switch threads and reopen the skill picker

#### Expected Results
- The picker shows a single top-level entry for the bundled skill or plugin root
- Nested subskill folder names and plugin-prefixed variants do not appear as separate skill discovery entries when the parent/root entry exists
- Grouped plugin roots render a clean label such as `cloudflare` instead of `cloudflare:cloudflare`
- The grouped result remains stable after refresh or thread switching

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Default mode can follow plan mode in the same thread

#### Feature/Change Name
Composer collaboration mode changes send `default` explicitly so a thread can leave plan mode without opening a new chat.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. A Codex account/session with both Default and Plan collaboration modes available
3. A project folder selected for a new or existing thread

#### Steps
1. Select Plan mode in the composer
2. Send a prompt asking Codex to create a plan
3. After the turn completes, switch the composer back to Default mode
4. Send a follow-up prompt asking Codex to implement the plan in the same thread
5. Repeat the Default follow-up once more in the same thread

#### Expected Results
- The implementation prompts run in Default mode instead of staying in Plan mode
- The thread remains usable without opening a new chat
- The composer selection and the backend turn mode stay aligned across consecutive turns

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Archive the test thread if it was created only for verification

---

### First-launch home card for Plugins and Apps

#### Feature/Change Name
The home route shows a dismissible first-launch card that introduces Plugins and Apps and opens the existing Skills & Apps directory on the Plugins tab.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Codex global-state preference `first-launch-plugins-card-dismissed` removed or set to `false` before the first check
3. App loaded on the home/new-thread route

#### Steps
1. Open the app on the home route with the local storage key removed
2. Verify the home screen shows a card with the heading `Plugins are here`
3. Verify the body copy mentions app examples such as Gmail and Calendar
4. Click `Explore Plugins & Apps`
5. Verify the app navigates to the `#/skills` route and the `Plugins` tab is active
6. Return to the home route and verify the card does not reappear
7. Remove the local storage key again, reload the home route, and click `Dismiss`
8. Reload the home route once more

#### Expected Results
- The card appears only when the server-backed dismissal preference is unset or `false`
- The primary CTA hides the card and opens the Skills & Apps directory
- The directory opens with `Plugins` selected by default
- Dismissing the card hides it immediately and keeps it hidden after reload

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove or set `first-launch-plugins-card-dismissed` to `false` in Codex global state if you want to see the card again

---

### Composer prompts inside Skills dropdown

#### Feature/Change Name
The composer control row uses one `Skills` dropdown for both skills and saved prompts. The `+` action creates a prompt, prompt rows can be inserted or removed from the same menu, and there is no separate `Prompt` control.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. Open any existing thread so the composer controls are enabled
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the composer controls and confirm `Skills` appears and no separate `Prompt` control is present
2. Open `Skills` and verify the popup matches the wider card-like layout with large stacked label/description rows
3. Confirm skill rows have compact source markers, such as `R` for repo, `U` for user, `S` for system, or `P` for plugin
4. Click the `+` action in the `Skills` dropdown, enter a unique prompt name such as `ui-test-prompt`, and enter sample content such as `Prompt dropdown smoke test`
5. Reopen `Skills` and confirm the new prompt appears with a `Prompt` marker and an inline `×` remove action
6. Click the prompt row and confirm the prompt text is inserted into the composer draft without toggling a skill
7. Reopen `Skills`, click the `×` button for `ui-test-prompt`, and confirm the removal dialog
8. Confirm the prompt disappears from the dropdown while skill rows remain available
9. Type `/` into the composer and verify no slash skill picker appears
10. Switch to dark theme and repeat the visibility check for the combined `Skills` dropdown contents

#### Expected Results
- The composer shows one `Skills` dropdown for skills and prompts; no standalone `Prompt` dropdown is rendered
- The combined `Skills` popup uses the wider rounded layout with vertically stacked label/description rows
- Skill rows show readable source markers that distinguish repo, user, system, and plugin-provided skills
- Prompt rows show a readable `Prompt` marker and are the only rows with an inline remove action
- Typing `/` in the composer does not open a skill picker
- The `+` action creates a markdown file in the Codex prompt store and adds it to the `Skills` dropdown immediately
- Selecting a saved prompt appends its content into the draft without sending the message
- Clicking `×` removes only the targeted prompt and updates the dropdown immediately
- Light theme and dark theme both keep the new control, menu, and remove action readable and usable

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete any temporary verification prompt created during the test

---

### Editable current folder path in the folder picker

#### Feature/Change Name
The `Select folder` dialog now lets the user edit the current folder path directly, reload that folder on `Enter` or blur, and open the typed path without first clicking a child row.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open the home/new-thread route
3. Have at least two accessible local directories available for navigation
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the `Select folder` dialog from the new-thread folder chooser
2. Confirm the `Current folder` field is an editable text input instead of static text
3. Type a different absolute path and press `Enter`
4. Confirm the folder list reloads for the typed path
5. Edit the path again, click outside the input, and confirm blur also reloads the listing
6. Type a valid absolute path and click `Open`
7. Reopen the dialog, switch to dark theme, and confirm the editable current-folder input remains readable and focusable

#### Expected Results
- The current-folder path can be typed into directly
- Pressing `Enter` on a changed path reloads the folder listing for that path
- Blurring a changed path also reloads the folder listing for that path
- Clicking `Open` uses the typed path when it is valid
- The input remains readable and has visible focus treatment in both light theme and dark theme

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Return the chooser to the original folder if the test changed the selected project path

---

### Expandable Projects, Pinned, and Chats sidebar sections

#### Feature/Change Name
The sidebar labels the grouped thread area as `Projects`, makes `Projects`, `Pinned`, and `Chats` independently expandable, and places `Chats` after `Projects` in the same scrollable sidebar area.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:5174` or the active Vite dev URL
2. At least one existing thread is available in the sidebar
3. At least one pinned thread exists to verify the `Pinned` section
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the app with the sidebar expanded
2. Verify the grouped thread header reads `Projects` instead of `Threads`
3. Verify `Pinned`, `Projects`, and `Chats` each show a chevron when present
4. Collapse and expand `Pinned`, confirming pinned rows hide and return
5. Collapse and expand `Projects`, confirming project groups hide and return
6. Confirm `Chats` appears after `Projects` and scrolls with the same sidebar content, not as a fixed bottom shelf
7. Collapse and expand `Chats`, confirming recent chat rows hide and return
8. Click the `Chats` filter icon and verify the existing sidebar search field opens and the filter button shows active state
9. Click the `Chats` compose icon and verify the app navigates to the new-chat/home composer
10. Open the Projects organize menu, enable `Chats first`, and verify `Chats` moves above `Projects`
11. In the same menu, switch `Sort by` between `Created` and `Updated`, then verify the active checkmark moves and the chat rows reorder by the selected timestamp
12. Refresh the page and verify `Chats first` and the selected sort mode persist
13. Switch to dark theme and repeat the visibility checks for section headers, chevrons, active filter state, sort menu state, and row text

#### Expected Results
- The sidebar uses `Projects` for the grouped project/thread area
- `Pinned`, `Projects`, and `Chats` expansion state changes immediately and persists across reload
- `Chats` is appended after `Projects` in the same scroll space
- `Chats first` moves the `Chats` section before `Projects` and persists across reload
- `Created` and `Updated` sort options update only the `Chats` ordering and persist across reload
- The filter icon toggles the sidebar search without losing the `Chats` section
- The compose icon starts a new chat using the existing new-thread flow
- Light theme and dark theme both keep section headers, controls, and rows readable

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear the sidebar search query if the filter step left it open

---

### Thread menu copy path action

#### Feature/Change Name
The thread overflow menu includes a `Copy path` item that copies the selected thread's working directory path.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:5174` or the active Vite dev URL
2. Open any existing thread with a known project path
3. Browser clipboard access is available
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, hover a thread row in the sidebar and open its overflow menu
2. Verify `Copy path` appears after `Browse files`
3. Click `Copy path`
4. Paste the clipboard contents into a text field or clipboard inspector
5. Reopen the same menu in dark theme and verify the item remains readable and in the same position

#### Expected Results
- The menu order is `Add automation...` or `Manage automations...`, `Browse files`, `Copy path`, `Export chat`, `Create chat fork`, `Rename thread`, `Delete thread`
- Clicking `Copy path` closes the menu
- Clipboard contents equal the thread's `cwd` path
- Light theme and dark theme both keep the menu item readable

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore any previous clipboard contents manually if needed

---

### Terminal quick commands from project files

#### Feature/Change Name
Terminal quick commands are discovered from the current project instead of using a static built-in npm list.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:5174` or the active Vite dev URL
2. Open a thread or new chat whose working directory has a `package.json` with scripts
3. Optionally create executable candidates under the project root and `scripts/`, such as `check.sh`, `scripts/check.sh`, or `scripts/build.cmd`
4. Optionally add `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lock`, or `bun.lockb` to verify package-manager detection
5. Optionally add a `Makefile` with simple targets such as `test:` or `build:`

#### Steps
1. Open the terminal panel for that project
2. Open the `Run...` dropdown
3. Verify each `package.json` script appears with the detected package manager, such as `pnpm run <script>`, `yarn <script>`, `bun run <script>`, or `npm run <script>`
4. Verify simple `Makefile` targets appear as `make <target>`
5. Verify root-level `*.sh` / `*.cmd` files appear as `./<file>`
6. Verify `scripts/*.sh` and `scripts/*.cmd` files appear as `./scripts/<file>`
7. Select one discovered command and confirm it is sent to the terminal
8. Reopen the dropdown after running commands multiple times
9. If the project has more commands than fit in the menu, scroll the dropdown and verify lower-priority entries such as `./scripts/<file>.sh` remain reachable
10. From a closed terminal state on a remote server, select a command immediately after opening the `Run...` menu and confirm it runs after the terminal attaches

#### Expected Results
- The dropdown is based on the current project `cwd`
- Static defaults like `npm run dev` do not appear unless they exist in that project's `package.json`
- Package script commands use the lockfile-preferred package manager
- Make targets are listed after package scripts
- Root and `scripts/` script-file commands are listed after Make targets
- Commands are sorted by most-used and then most-recent usage, and the dropdown scrolls instead of hiding entries beyond the first five
- Selecting a command while the terminal is still mounting waits for the attach flow instead of dropping the command

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any temporary files created under the project root or `scripts/`

### Queue mode is default for in-progress messages

#### Feature/Change Name
When a turn is already running, the in-progress message path defaults to `Queue` for new sessions and existing users without a saved preference.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open any existing thread with message composer enabled
3. Start from a clean setting state by clearing localStorage key `codex-web-local.in-progress-send-mode` if present
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. Open a thread and ensure no previous turn is running
2. Confirm settings shows `When busy` line labeled as `Queue`
3. Send a message that triggers an in-progress response
4. While the response is running, submit a second message and observe submit mode label / destination behavior
5. Open the queue list and confirm the second message is queued
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat step 4 using another thread

#### Expected Results
- The in-progress setting defaults to `Queue` when no saved preference exists
- A second message sent during an active turn is queued, not used as steer
- Queue order and queued item actions remain functional in both light theme and dark theme

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear the queue by sending/steering queued items or deleting queued rows

---

### Backend-persisted queued messages and drag reorder

#### Feature/Change Name
Queued messages are saved through the backend, survive page refresh, and can be reordered by dragging a queued row before another queued row.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open a thread where a turn is actively running
3. Queue at least three messages while the turn is running
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, confirm each queued row has a drag handle at the start of the row
2. Refresh the page and reopen the same thread
3. Confirm all queued rows are still visible in the same order
4. Drag the third queued message onto the first queued message
5. Confirm the third message moves to the first position and the remaining queued messages keep their relative order
6. Refresh again and confirm the reordered queue order is preserved
7. Let the active turn finish and confirm the next sent queued message is the first reordered item
8. Queue at least two more messages, switch to dark theme, and repeat the drag reorder check

#### Expected Results
- Queued rows survive a page refresh because they are restored from backend state
- Dragging a queued row onto another queued row immediately reorders the queue
- The reordered queue order survives page refresh
- The reordered queue order controls which message sends next after the active turn finishes
- Edit, Steer, and Delete actions still operate on the correct queued row after reordering
- Drag handle, hover/drop target, and row text remain readable in both light theme and dark theme

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete any queued test messages that should not be sent

---

### Backend-drained queue UI refresh

#### Feature/Change Name
The queue panel refreshes when the backend starts and drains persisted queued messages.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open a `TestChat` thread
3. Queue at least three short messages while a turn is running
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, confirm queued rows are visible above the composer
2. Let the backend drain each queued message
3. Confirm the queue panel removes each row as its queued turn starts
4. Confirm the queue panel disappears when the final queued message is submitted
5. Refresh the thread after all queued turns complete
6. Switch to dark theme and repeat the visibility check after queue drain

#### Expected Results
- Queued messages execute in order after the active turn completes
- The queue panel reflects backend queue state after `turn/started` and `turn/completed`
- No already-executed queued rows remain visible after the queue is empty
- Queue row text, actions, and composer spacing remain readable in both light theme and dark theme

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete any remaining queued test messages or let the queue drain

---

### Persisted idle queue recovery

#### Feature/Change Name
Backend queued messages are retried and drained for idle threads even if the original `turn/completed` notification was missed or the server starts with persisted queue state already present.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. A thread exists with queued messages persisted in `/codex-api/thread-queue-state`
3. The thread's latest turn is completed/idle
4. Light theme and dark theme are both available

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the thread with persisted queued rows
2. Confirm the queued rows are visible above the composer
3. Wait for backend queue recovery to start the first queued message
4. Confirm the first queued row is removed and a new turn starts
5. Wait for the queued turn to complete
6. Confirm the next queued row starts automatically
7. Repeat until `/codex-api/thread-queue-state` no longer includes the thread
8. Refresh the thread and confirm all queued messages completed in order
9. Switch to dark theme and confirm the completed conversation and empty queue state remain readable

#### Expected Results
- Idle persisted queues recover without requiring a new manual message
- Queued messages do not start while the thread has an in-progress turn
- Multiple queued messages drain one at a time and complete in order
- The queue panel disappears after the final queued message is started
- The recovered turns and empty queue state are visible in both light theme and dark theme

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete any remaining queued test rows or let recovery drain them
- Remove temporary test projects/threads if they are no longer needed

### ChatGPT auth tokens refresh for external auth

#### Feature/Change Name
Codex app-server `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh` requests are handled automatically from `auth.json` so expired ChatGPT access tokens can be refreshed without a manual relogin.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. App server is running from this repository
2. `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` contains ChatGPT auth with a valid `refresh_token`
3. The current ChatGPT `access_token` is expired or close enough to expiry that Codex app-server asks for token refresh

#### Steps
1. Open the app with the ChatGPT-authenticated account selected
2. Trigger an account operation such as loading account rate limits or starting a normal Codex turn
3. Watch the server logs for an `account/chatgptAuthTokens/refresh` server request
4. Reopen `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`
5. Repeat the same account operation after the refresh completes

#### Expected Results
- The refresh request is answered automatically and does not appear as a manual pending request in the UI
- `auth.json` is updated with the fresh `access_token` and any rotated `refresh_token` or `id_token`
- The account operation succeeds without showing `token_expired`
- If no refresh token is available, the operation fails with a sign-in-again message instead of silently looping

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None, unless a test-only `$CODEX_HOME` was used

---

### Project menu permanent worktree action

#### Feature/Change Name
Project rows open the same action menu from right-click and the dots button, and can create a permanent sibling Git worktree as a new project.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Sidebar has at least one Git-backed project
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, click the project row dots button.
2. Verify the menu shows `Browse files`, `New worktree`, `Rename project`, and `Remove`.
3. Close the menu, then right-click the same project row.
4. Verify the same menu opens.
5. Click `Browse files` and confirm the local file browser opens for the project cwd.
6. Reopen the project menu, click `Rename project`, and confirm the inline project name input still works.
7. Reopen the project menu, click `New worktree`, and confirm the prompt is prefilled with `<project name>-`.
8. Enter a unique folder name such as `<project name>-manual-test`.
9. Confirm a Git worktree is created at `../<worktree name>` relative to the source repo root.
10. Run `git -C ../<worktree name> branch --show-current` and confirm it prints a branch based on the worktree folder name.
11. Confirm the new worktree is added as a project and the app opens the new-chat composer with that cwd selected.
12. Rename the project to include a slash, reopen `New worktree`, and confirm the suggested folder name replaces the slash with `-`.
13. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-4, verifying menu contrast and danger styling remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- Right-click and dots button expose the same project action menu.
- `Browse files`, `Rename project`, and `Remove` remain available from that menu.
- `New worktree` creates a permanent sibling worktree folder on its own branch, registers it as a project, and opens a new chat for it.
- Invalid path separator characters are not used in the default worktree folder suggestion.
- Menu text, hover states, and the remove action remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the test worktree with `git -C <source-repo-root> worktree remove ../<worktree name>`.
- Delete the test branch with `git -C <source-repo-root> branch -D <branch name>`.
- Remove the temporary project from the sidebar if it remains listed.

### Sidebar thread inline delete confirmation and menu pin action

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread rows show an inline delete button that morphs to `Confirm`, while pin/unpin moves to the thread context menu.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Sidebar contains at least two disposable test threads
3. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, hover a disposable thread row and verify the left-side action shows a delete icon instead of a pin icon
2. Click the delete icon once and verify it changes to a `Confirm` button without selecting the row
3. Click a different thread row and verify the pending `Confirm` state clears
4. Hover the disposable thread row again, click delete, then click `Confirm`
5. Verify the thread is removed from the sidebar immediately and, if it was pinned, removed from the `Pinned` section too
6. Open another thread row context menu and verify it contains `Pin thread` for an unpinned thread
7. Click `Pin thread`, reopen the same thread menu, and verify it now shows `Unpin thread`
8. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1 through 7 with another disposable thread

#### Expected Results
- The inline row action is delete, not pin
- Delete requires two clicks: delete icon, then `Confirm`
- Confirming archives/removes the correct thread immediately from the sidebar and clears any pinned state for that thread
- Pin/unpin is available from the thread context menu and updates the `Pinned` section immediately
- Delete icon, `Confirm` button, and context menu items are readable in both light theme and dark theme

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete or unpin any disposable threads created only for this test

---

### Accounts panel Codex login callback modal

#### Feature/Change Name
Accounts settings includes an always-available `Login` button that starts `codex login`, opens the returned authorization URL, shows an in-app callback modal, requests the pasted localhost callback URL from the server, and imports the completed Codex account.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. `codex` CLI available in the server process `PATH`
3. Browser can open the authorization URL returned by the server
4. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. Open settings and expand `Accounts`.
2. In light theme, verify `Login` appears even when an active account is already listed.
3. Click `Login`.
4. Verify a new tab opens to the OpenAI authorization URL and an in-app `Complete Codex login` modal asks for the localhost callback URL.
5. Complete authorization in the browser until it redirects to a `http://localhost:<port>/auth/callback?...` URL.
6. Paste that full localhost callback URL into the modal input and click `Complete`.
7. Verify the account list refreshes, the new or refreshed account is active, and normal thread/account data reloads.
8. Click `Login` again, close the modal, and verify the Accounts panel keeps the `Open login URL` fallback link available.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-4, verifying the Login button, link, modal, input, and buttons have readable contrast.

#### Expected Results
- `Login` is available regardless of current login state.
- Starting login runs `codex login` on the server and exposes the generated OpenAI authorization URL.
- Completing login uses the modal input value, only accepts local callback URLs, and uses the server to request the pasted callback.
- After completion, `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` is imported into the Accounts list and selected as the active account.
- Completion does not remain stuck waiting for the `codex login` process after the callback has updated `auth.json`.
- Light-theme and dark-theme controls are readable and do not overlap.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any test-only account from the Accounts panel if needed.
- If a login is abandoned, restart the dev server to clear any in-memory pending login process.

### Active thread switches after delete

#### Feature/Change Name
Deleting the currently open thread immediately selects the next available thread.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Sidebar contains at least three disposable test threads
3. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the middle disposable thread
2. Click that thread's delete icon, then click `Confirm`
3. Verify the content area immediately switches to the next thread in the sidebar list
4. Open the last disposable thread
5. Delete and confirm it
6. Verify the content area immediately switches to the previous thread
7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 in dark theme

#### Expected Results
- Deleting the active thread does not leave the deleted thread selected
- The next thread is selected immediately; when there is no next thread, the previous thread is selected
- The browser route updates to the newly selected thread without waiting for a manual click
- A stale deleted-thread URL does not switch the UI back to the archived thread
- Light-theme and dark-theme sidebar selection states remain readable after the automatic switch

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete any disposable threads created only for this test

---

### Thread open always autoscrolls to latest

#### Feature/Change Name
Opening a thread always scrolls the conversation to the latest messages, with no per-thread scroll restore.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. At least one thread with enough messages to require scrolling
3. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open a thread and scroll to the middle of its history
2. Switch to another thread
3. Open the first thread again
4. Verify the viewport opens at the bottom (latest messages), not the previous middle position
5. Refresh the browser tab, open the same thread again, and verify it still opens at the bottom
6. Repeat steps 1 through 5 in dark theme

#### Expected Results
- Opening a thread always lands on the latest messages
- Previously viewed scroll positions are not restored when revisiting a thread
- Browser refresh does not restore a previously viewed conversation scroll position
- Behavior is the same in light theme and dark theme

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None

---

### Hide worktree controls for non-Git folders

#### Feature/Change Name
Composer runtime options and project menu worktree actions are hidden when the selected folder is not a Git repository.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. One Git-backed project and one plain local folder without a `.git` directory are available in the folder picker/sidebar
3. Light theme and dark theme are available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, select the plain local folder in the new-thread composer.
2. Confirm the `Local project` / `New worktree` runtime toggle is not shown.
3. Confirm the first message can still be sent as a normal local-folder chat.
4. Select a Git-backed folder and confirm the runtime toggle appears again.
5. Open the project action menu for a non-Git project and confirm `New worktree` is not shown.
6. Open the project action menu for a Git-backed project and confirm `New worktree` is shown.
7. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

#### Expected Results
- Non-Git folders do not show `Local project` or `New worktree` runtime options.
- Non-Git project menus do not show `New worktree`.
- Git-backed folders continue to expose the runtime toggle and worktree action.
- The hidden/visible states are consistent and readable in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove any disposable plain folder or test chats created for this validation.

---

### Project worktree threads under canonical project

#### Feature/Change Name
Managed worktree threads remain visible under their matching canonical workspace-root project, and path-like project tooltips expose the full path.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Codex global workspace roots include `/Users/igor/Git-projects/codex-web-local`
3. Thread history contains at least one thread whose cwd is under `/Users/igor/.codex/worktrees/*/codex-web-local`
4. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the sidebar Projects section.
2. Scroll to the `codex-web-local` project.
3. Confirm the project includes the main-root thread and managed worktree threads.
4. Confirm worktree rows still show the worktree icon.
5. Confirm unrelated `.git/worktrees` rows with the same leaf folder name are not grouped into this project.
6. Hover any shortened path-like duplicate project title and confirm the tooltip shows the full project path, not only the friendly label.
7. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-6.

#### Expected Results
- Managed worktree threads with the same leaf folder name are not split into hidden path-like project groups.
- Generic `.git/worktrees` rows are not treated as managed Codex worktrees for project-root grouping.
- The canonical `codex-web-local` project shows both main-root and worktree threads.
- Path-like project tooltips expose the full project path.
- Project rows and worktree icons remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

---

### Worktree creation persists across refresh

#### Feature/Change Name
Newly created temporary and permanent worktrees are persisted in workspace roots so their threads remain visible after a full browser refresh.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. A Git-backed workspace root is registered and selected in the Start new thread screen
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open Start new thread for the Git-backed workspace root.
2. Select `New worktree`, send a unique first prompt, and wait for the thread page to open.
3. Note the created worktree path from the selected folder or thread metadata.
4. Refresh the browser tab.
5. Confirm the new worktree-backed project/thread remains visible in the sidebar and can be opened.
6. Open the project action menu for the original Git-backed project and create a permanent named worktree.
7. Confirm the permanent worktree appears in the folder/project list, then refresh the browser tab.
8. Confirm the permanent worktree remains visible after refresh.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1 through 5 with a second unique temporary worktree prompt.

#### Expected Results
- Temporary worktree creation writes the new worktree cwd to persisted workspace roots.
- Permanent worktree creation writes the new worktree cwd to persisted workspace roots.
- Full page refresh does not hide the newly created worktree project or its thread.
- The same behavior works in light theme and dark theme.
- If workspace-root persistence fails after `git worktree add`, the request fails cleanly and best-effort rollback removes the created worktree instead of leaving retry-prone orphaned worktrees.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove temporary test worktrees with `git worktree remove --force <worktree-path>`.
- Delete any empty temporary parent directory left under `$CODEX_HOME/worktrees/<id>`.
- Remove permanent test worktrees with `git worktree remove --force <worktree-path>` and delete their test branch if needed.

### Sidebar chats show more projectless chats

#### Feature/Change Name
The sidebar Chats section lists the first 10 projectless chats, offers Show more for the rest, and no longer shows the per-section filter button.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Thread history contains more than 10 projectless chats
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the sidebar Chats section.
2. Count the visible projectless chat rows and confirm only 10 rows are shown initially.
3. Click Show more and confirm older projectless chat rows beyond the first 10 appear.
4. Click Show less and confirm the Chats section returns to 10 visible rows.
5. Confirm the Chats section header only shows the New chat action and does not show a filter button.
6. Use the main sidebar search button and confirm global thread search still opens and filters chats/projects without the 10-row browsing limit.
7. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-6.

#### Expected Results
- The Chats section shows 10 projectless chats by default according to the selected chat sort mode.
- Show more expands the section to all projectless chats, and Show less restores the 10-row default.
- The Chats header does not include a filter action.
- The New chat action remains available.
- The main sidebar search remains functional.
- Rows and header actions remain readable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Fresh Docker mobile install does not show rate-limit request failures

#### Feature/Change Name
Fresh unauthenticated install mobile home screen rate-limit handling.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Docker is available.
2. A clean container has this project installed under `/workspace`.
3. `@openai/codex` is installed in the container.
4. Container dev server is running with a fresh Codex home:
   `CODEX_HOME=/tmp/codex-home CODEXUI_CODEX_COMMAND=$(command -v codex) pnpm run dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173`
5. The container port is mapped to the host, for example `127.0.0.1:4174 -> 4173`.

#### Steps
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4174/` in a mobile viewport such as iPhone 13 `390x664`.
2. In light theme, wait for the Start new thread home screen to render.
3. Capture network responses and confirm no `/codex-api/rpc` response fails with `502` for `account/rateLimits/read`.
4. Confirm the composer renders and the quota UI is simply absent when the fresh `CODEX_HOME` has no authenticated Codex account.
5. Switch to dark theme and reload the same mobile viewport.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 4 in dark theme.
7. Add an `auth.json` containing only `tokens.access_token` and confirm `account/rateLimits/read` is not short-circuited as unauthenticated.
8. Replace `auth.json` with malformed JSON and confirm the server logs a `[codex-auth] Unable to read Codex auth state` warning while the home screen still renders.

#### Expected Results
- The fresh mobile home screen renders without a blank page.
- `account/rateLimits/read` returns an empty result instead of a `502` when no Codex account is authenticated.
- An access-token-only auth file is treated as authenticated enough to ask Codex for rate limits.
- Malformed auth files are visible in server logs instead of being silently treated as a normal fresh install.
- The UI remains usable in light theme and dark theme.
- No login or account import is required just to load the home screen.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop and remove the temporary Docker container, for example `docker rm -f <container-name>`.

### Android published CLI loads Codex app-server models through local proxy

#### Feature/Change Name
Android `codexui-android` startup passes the bound server port to app-server free-mode config.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Android proot access works through `/Users/igor/Git-projects/codex-web-local-android/andClaw-codex/ssh.sh`.
2. The published `codexui-android` package version under test is available from npm.
3. ADB forward maps device port `17923` to local port `17923`.

#### Steps
1. Start the package in Android proot:
   `pnpm dlx codexui-android@<version> --port 17923 --no-open --no-tunnel --no-login`
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:17923/#/` in the browser.
3. Call `POST /codex-api/rpc` with `{"method":"config/read","params":{}}`.
4. Call `POST /codex-api/rpc` with `{"method":"model/list","params":{}}`.
5. Confirm `/codex-api/provider-models` still returns OpenCode Zen model ids.
6. Verify the model selector is enabled in light theme and dark theme.
7. Send `hi` from the home composer and wait for the first assistant reply.
8. Confirm browser/network logs do not show a `502` for `generate-thread-title` or an empty-rollout `thread/read` during startup.

#### Expected Results
- `config/read` returns `200` and includes `model_providers.opencode-zen.base_url` pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:17923/codex-api/zen-proxy/v1`.
- `config/read` includes `model_providers.opencode-zen.wire_api` as `responses`, not `chat`.
- Fresh no-auth startup uses OpenCode Zen as a runtime fallback without creating `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json`.
- After a usable Codex `auth.json` is added and the server restarts with no saved free-mode state, startup does not keep forcing `model_provider="opencode-zen"`.
- Existing `~/.codex/webui-free-mode.json` files are ignored and not migrated to `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json`.
- `model/list` returns `200` with model data instead of `502 codex app-server exited unexpectedly`.
- The model selector is usable in both light theme and dark theme.
- A first home-composer message creates a thread and receives a response without visible startup RPC errors.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Android proot process with `pkill -f codexui-android` if needed.

---

### OpenCode Zen status returns current provider models

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenCode Zen free-mode status and model discovery consistency.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server or published CLI server running with no Codex auth so free mode defaults to OpenCode Zen.
2. Browser can open the home route in light theme and dark theme.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the home route.
2. Call `GET /codex-api/free-mode/status`.
3. Call `GET /codex-api/provider-models`.
4. Confirm both responses report OpenCode Zen data, including `big-pickle` and current Zen model ids such as `deepseek-v4-flash-free` when upstream returns it.
5. Confirm `/codex-api/free-mode/status` reports `wireApi` as `responses`.
6. Open the model selector immediately after initial page load and confirm the Zen models are available without first switching providers or refreshing settings.
7. In Chrome with a previously loaded app version, reload the page and confirm the service worker fetches the new script/style bundle instead of keeping stale cached selector behavior.
8. With a script/style bundle already cached by the service worker, temporarily make the same script/style request return HTTP 404 or 500 and reload.
9. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1 through 8.

#### Expected Results
- Free-mode status does not expose stale OpenRouter cached model ids when `provider` is `opencode-zen`.
- OpenCode Zen uses `responses`, not `chat`, in saved/default UI state.
- Provider model discovery and status agree on the model list source.
- Initial startup model loading uses the active provider context and does not leave GPT-only `model/list` entries as the visible selector list for OpenCode Zen.
- Selected model ids persist to localStorage by thread/provider context; legacy/global selected-model keys cannot choose a model for OpenCode Zen, while a valid provider-scoped OpenCode Zen saved choice is restored.
- Service-worker script/style cache invalidation does not keep Chrome on an older model-selector bundle after a new local build is served.
- Service-worker script/style fetches still use a cached bundle if the network request resolves with a non-OK HTTP status.
- Model selector content remains usable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Thread conversation loads earlier turns on demand

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread conversation incremental older-turn loading.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
2. A thread with more than 10 turns is available
3. Light theme and dark theme both available from the appearance switcher

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open a thread that has more than 10 turns.
2. Confirm the newest messages render first and the conversation shows the Load earlier messages control at the top.
3. Click Load earlier messages once.
4. Confirm an older batch is prepended above the previously first visible turn and the scroll position stays near the same content.
5. Continue clicking Load earlier messages until the control disappears.
6. Confirm the oldest messages in the thread are visible and no duplicate message rows are introduced.
7. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 1-6 on the same thread or another long thread.

#### Expected Results
- Initial thread open remains bounded to the latest turn page.
- Load earlier messages fetches older persisted turns from the local bridge instead of only revealing already-loaded messages.
- The control remains available while older persisted turns exist and disappears after the first turn is loaded.
- Message ordering, turn actions, and scroll restoration remain stable in light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Docker auth startup live-state pending read

#### Feature/Change Name
Docker authenticated first-turn live-state pending read handling.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Build the project with `pnpm run build`.
2. Build a fresh Docker image that installs `@openai/codex` and runs the packed `codexapp` artifact.
3. Prepare two isolated `CODEX_HOME` states: one empty and one with only `auth.json` mounted.

#### Steps
1. Start the no-auth container and open the app in light theme.
2. Confirm `config/read` uses `model_provider="opencode-zen"` and `model="big-pickle"`.
3. Send `hi` and wait for the assistant reply.
4. Start the auth-mounted container and open the app in light theme.
5. Confirm `config/read` has `model_provider=null` and no Zen provider override.
6. Send `hi` and poll `/codex-api/thread-live-state?threadId=<id>` while the first turn is starting.
7. Confirm early live-state responses do not expose `liveStateError.kind="readFailed"` for `not materialized yet; includeTurns is unavailable before first user message`.
8. Wait for the assistant reply, then switch to dark theme and repeat the visual checks for the composer/thread area.

#### Expected Results
- No-auth Docker startup falls back to Zen at runtime and returns a `hi` response.
- Auth-mounted Docker startup uses the default Codex provider path without Zen flags and returns a `hi` response.
- The transient first-turn materialization window is represented as an in-progress empty live state, not a visible chat error.
- Real `thread/read` failures still surface through `liveStateError`.
- Light theme and dark theme keep the chat/composer readable throughout the first-turn transition.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop temporary containers with `docker rm -f codexui-noauth-test codexui-auth-test` when finished.

### Provider models load without Codex model-list dependency

#### Feature/Change Name
Provider-backed model selector startup loading.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Build the project with `pnpm run build`.
2. Run a no-auth Docker container so Codex Web Local starts with OpenCode Zen fallback.
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/#/` in the browser.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the home screen and wait for initial model loading.
2. Open the model selector.
3. Confirm Zen provider models are visible even if Codex `model/list` is slow or unavailable.
4. Confirm the selector starts with `big-pickle` and includes current Zen models such as `deepseek-v4-flash-free`.
5. Switch to dark theme and repeat steps 2 through 4.

#### Expected Results
- Provider-backed model loading asks `/codex-api/provider-models` before depending on `model/list`.
- OpenCode Zen models populate the selector without falling back to a blank list or stale Codex-only model list.
- The selector remains readable and usable in light theme and dark theme.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Docker container when finished.

---

### Invalid or expired auth errors appear in chat

#### Feature/Change Name
Invalid Codex auth failed-turn error rendering.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Build the project with `pnpm run build`.
2. Build a fresh Docker image from the packed artifact.
3. Start a Docker container with an invalid or expired `auth.json` mounted into `CODEX_HOME`.
4. Open the container URL in the browser.

#### Steps
1. Confirm `config/read` uses the default Codex provider path, not OpenCode Zen fallback.
2. Send `hi` from the composer.
3. Wait until the turn stops running.
4. Reload or reopen the same thread.
5. Repeat in dark theme and light theme.

#### Expected Results
- The failed turn displays the final auth error in the chat, including the HTTP 401/unauthorized message from Codex.
- The failed turn includes a visible `Send feedback` button next to the persisted chat error.
- Once the failed turn is persisted, the live `Thinking` error overlay is gone so the final auth error is not duplicated.
- The conversation does not silently show only the user message after a failed turn.
- Reloaded thread history preserves the failed-turn error message.
- Transient retry messages may appear while reconnecting, but the final non-retry error remains visible after completion.
- In dark theme and light theme, the feedback button remains readable and opens a feedback mailto with the visible auth error included in the diagnostic body.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the invalid-auth Docker container after verification.

---

### Docker provider checklist and live error overlay regression

#### Feature/Change Name
Docker provider/auth checklist execution and live error overlay de-duplication.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Run `pnpm run build`.
2. Run `pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp`.
3. Build a Docker image from the packed `codexapp` tarball with `@openai/codex` installed.
4. Start three isolated containers:
   - no auth file
   - invalid or expired `auth.json`
   - malformed `auth.json`

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the no-auth container, confirm the composer starts on `big-pickle`, send `hi`, and wait for an assistant reply.
2. Switch the Settings provider selector to OpenRouter, send `hi` again, and wait for a reply or provider-scoped response.
3. Open the invalid-auth container, send `hi`, wait for the final 401/auth error, and confirm `Send feedback` is visible.
4. Reload the invalid-auth thread and confirm the persisted error remains without a duplicate live `Thinking` error overlay.
5. Switch the invalid-auth thread to dark theme and confirm the persisted error and feedback button remain readable.
6. Open the malformed-auth container, confirm it falls back to `big-pickle`, send `hi`, and wait for an assistant reply.

#### Expected Results
- No-auth startup uses the OpenCode Zen runtime fallback and sends successfully.
- Runtime `-c` provider config uses underscore-safe provider ids, so Zen/OpenRouter/custom providers are actually registered with Codex app-server.
- Provider switching is scoped to the selected provider and does not require changing the model dropdown directly.
- Invalid/expired auth stays on the Codex provider path and renders the final auth failure as a persisted chat error.
- A new live error is still visible when an older persisted turn error exists, but the same live error is suppressed after that exact error has persisted.
- Feedback mailto diagnostics include recent diagnostics, visible page text, and the visible auth error.
- Malformed auth is treated as unusable auth and falls back to Zen.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop temporary containers with `docker rm -f codexui-what-noauth codexui-what-invalid-auth codexui-what-malformed-auth`.

### Copied auth promotes community fallback to Codex

#### Feature/Change Name
Runtime auth detection after starting without auth.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Run `pnpm run build`.
2. Run `pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp`.
3. Build a Docker image from the packed `codexapp` tarball with `@openai/codex` installed.
4. Start a fresh no-auth container with an empty mounted `CODEX_HOME`.
5. Keep a valid host `auth.json` available to copy into that mounted `CODEX_HOME`.

#### Steps
1. Open the no-auth container and confirm the provider is OpenCode Zen with `big-pickle`.
2. Switch the Settings provider selector to OpenRouter while still unauthenticated.
3. Copy a valid `auth.json` into the mounted `CODEX_HOME`.
4. Reload the page.
5. Confirm the provider has moved to Codex, the composer shows a concrete Codex model instead of a generic `Model` placeholder, and the Accounts count imports the active auth account.
6. Confirm the sidebar does not show a stale `Send feedback` / `Issue detected` row when there is no current visible error.
7. Send `hi` on the Codex provider and wait for an assistant reply.

#### Expected Results
- Community fallback providers are suppressed once usable Codex auth appears.
- User-configured providers with a custom key or custom endpoint remain available and are not suppressed.
- The app refreshes model metadata after provider promotion so the composer does not stay on a generic `Model` label.
- The copied auth file is imported into the accounts list without requiring a manual Reload click after Codex quota metadata loads successfully.
- Invalid or expired copied auth is not imported during startup before a successful quota read, so the first failed send still renders a chat error instead of leaving the thread empty.
- The Settings feedback row is hidden after provider/account recovery unless there is still a visible error.
- The Codex provider can send a message successfully after auth promotion.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary container and remove its mounted `CODEX_HOME` directory.

### Android OpenCode Zen no-auth model filtering

#### Feature/Change Name
Android no-auth OpenCode Zen model list is limited to usable free models.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Build the web and CLI artifacts with `pnpm run build`.
2. Pack the current branch with `pnpm pack --pack-destination output/playwright/android-ssh-fulltest`.
3. Install the tarball into the Android proot through `/Users/igor/Git-projects/codex-web-local-android/andClaw-codex/ssh.sh`.
4. Remove `~/.codex/auth.json` and `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json` inside the Android proot.
5. Start `codexui --port 18935 --no-password --no-tunnel --no-open --no-login` inside the Android proot.
6. Forward the port with `adb -s <device> forward tcp:18935 tcp:18935`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:18935/#/` at a mobile viewport.
2. Confirm the composer starts on `big-pickle`.
3. Open the model menu and confirm it only contains `big-pickle` and `*-free` OpenCode Zen models.
4. Send `hi retest no auth default` and wait for a reply.
5. Switch the model to `deepseek-v4-flash-free`, send `hi retest no auth switched`, and wait for a reply or visible error.
6. Repeat the menu visibility check in dark theme.
7. Restore a valid `~/.codex/auth.json`, clear `~/.codex/webui-custom-providers.json`, start a fresh server on another port, and confirm the composer returns to Codex models such as `GPT-5.4-mini`.

#### Expected Results
- `/codex-api/provider-models` returns an exclusive no-auth Zen list containing only `big-pickle` and free models.
- No-auth Android startup does not expose Codex/GPT, Claude, Gemini, or other paid Zen models unless a user Zen key is configured.
- The no-auth default and switched free model sends both produce a visible assistant reply or visible provider error.
- With valid Codex auth restored, community fallback state is suppressed and the model menu shows Codex models.
- Light and dark theme menus remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Restore the original `~/.codex/auth.json` if it was backed up for no-auth testing.
- Stop temporary Android proot `codexui` processes or leave only the intended test port forwarded.

---

### Docker auth promotion preserves legacy Zen threads

#### Feature/Change Name
Legacy OpenCode Zen threads remain readable and provider-locked, while new threads use Codex once valid Codex auth appears.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Run `pnpm run build`.
2. Run `pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp`.
3. Build a Docker image from the packed `codexapp` tarball with `@openai/codex` installed.
4. Start a fresh no-auth Docker container with an empty `CODEX_HOME`.
5. Keep a valid host `auth.json` available to copy into `/codex-home/auth.json`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the no-auth container URL at a mobile viewport.
2. Send `hi` and wait for an assistant reply from the default OpenCode Zen fallback.
3. Confirm the composer model is `big-pickle`.
4. Copy valid Codex auth into the same container and restart the container.
5. Reload the same thread URL.
6. Confirm the previous Zen-backed messages still render and the composer model menu still shows only Zen models.
7. Send another `hi` in the same thread and wait for a Zen assistant reply.
8. Repeat the loaded-thread and model-label checks in dark theme.

#### Expected Results
- App-server config passively registers `opencode_zen` even when usable Codex auth suppresses the community fallback as the global provider.
- The route stays on the requested thread instead of redirecting home when the active provider's thread list omits the legacy thread.
- The UI renders a chat error with feedback if thread loading fails; it does not show an empty thread silently.
- After valid Codex auth promotion, the same thread remains on the Zen provider/model list, while a newly created thread uses Codex models.
- Follow-up sends recover from a restarted app-server process by resuming the thread once before retrying `turn/start`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Docker container and remove any copied `auth.json` from its `CODEX_HOME`.

---

### Thread-locked providers across Zen, Codex, and OpenRouter

#### Feature/Change Name
Threads capture their provider at creation time and keep provider-scoped model menus and sends.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Create a fresh temporary `CODEX_HOME` with no `auth.json`.
2. Start the app locally with Vite only: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
3. Keep a valid host auth file at `/Users/igor/.codex/auth.json`.
4. Keep a valid OpenRouter key available.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.
2. Create a project chat with no auth present and confirm the provider is OpenCode Zen.
3. Open the model menu and confirm it only shows Zen models, including `big-pickle`, with no GPT/Codex entries.
4. Send `hi` and confirm the request uses `big-pickle` and a visible assistant reply appears.
5. Copy `/Users/igor/.codex/auth.json` into the isolated `CODEX_HOME` while the Vite server is still running, reload the app, and confirm the new-chat composer switches from `big-pickle` to a Codex/GPT model.
6. Restart the Vite server with the same `CODEX_HOME`, reload the app, and confirm the composer still shows Codex/GPT models.
7. In the same project, create a new chat and confirm it uses the current global Codex provider.
8. Open the model menu and confirm it only shows Codex/GPT models, with no Zen entries.
9. Send `hi` and confirm the request uses a GPT model and a visible assistant reply appears.
10. Reopen the old Zen thread, confirm the model menu still shows only Zen models, send `hi`, and confirm the request still uses `big-pickle` with a visible assistant reply.
11. Switch Settings provider to OpenRouter, configure the OpenRouter API key, and create another new chat in the same project.
12. Confirm the new chat uses OpenRouter, the model menu shows only OpenRouter models, and `hi` sends through OpenRouter with a visible assistant reply.
13. Reopen the Zen, Codex, and OpenRouter threads in the same project and confirm each model menu remains provider-scoped and each send uses that thread's provider.
14. Repeat the provider label and model menu checks in dark theme.

#### Expected Results
- Existing threads use their captured `modelProvider`, not the current global provider, for model-list filtering and sends.
- New chats use the current global provider at creation time and do not inherit stale models from previously opened project threads.
- Copying Codex auth into a running no-auth Vite session restarts stale Zen app-server config before the next model/config RPC, so Settings and the composer cannot disagree.
- Projects can contain Zen, Codex, and OpenRouter threads at the same time without mixed provider/model state.
- Light and dark theme model menus remain readable and provider-specific.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server.
- Remove the temporary isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
- Restore the preferred provider in Settings if it was changed during testing.

---

### Missing thread route errors render in chat

#### Feature/Change Name
Thread route load failures are visible in the conversation instead of silently showing an empty chat.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Start the app with a `CODEX_HOME` that does not contain the target thread id.
2. Use local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/thread/<missing-thread-id>`.
2. Wait for thread loading to finish.
3. Confirm the conversation area shows the `thread/resume` or `thread/read` failure text and a `Send feedback` link.
4. Confirm the model selector still loads the active provider model list instead of staying on disabled `Model`.
5. Repeat in dark theme and confirm the error text, feedback link, and model selector remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- The route does not fail silently with only `No messages in this thread yet`.
- The chat area displays the load error as a visible overlay.
- The model dropdown loads independently of the missing thread and remains usable for the current provider.
- Light and dark theme error surfaces are readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Navigate back to home or a valid thread.
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.

### First user message is visible immediately in new chats

#### Feature/Change Name
New-thread sends render the submitted user message immediately, even when the backend thread read lags behind the assistant response.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Create a fresh isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
2. Start local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
3. Use an explicit test project folder to avoid projectless folder-name collisions from repeated `hi` tests.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/?openProjectPath=<encoded-test-project-path>`.
2. Send `hi` in a new unauthenticated chat and confirm the conversation pane immediately shows the user row `hi`.
3. Copy `/Users/igor/.codex/auth.json` to `<temp-home>/auth.json`.
4. Restart the same Vite server with the same `CODEX_HOME`.
5. Open the same project path, create another new chat, and send `hi`.
6. Confirm the conversation pane immediately shows the user row `hi`, then wait for the assistant response.
7. Select `GPT-5.4-mini` in a post-auth new chat, send `hi`, and confirm the user row appears before the assistant response finishes.
8. Repeat in dark theme and confirm the user row remains visible before and after the assistant response.

#### Expected Results
- The submitted first user message appears in the conversation pane immediately after send.
- Backend refreshes that contain only the assistant item do not temporarily remove the optimistic user row.
- When the backend later returns the real user item, the optimistic row is replaced without a duplicate.
- Completion events refresh the selected thread even when it was already marked loaded by an optimistic first message.
- Delayed GPT-5.4-mini replies appear automatically when the completion notification arrives; no manual refresh is required.
- Light and dark theme message rows remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server.
- Remove the temporary isolated `CODEX_HOME` and test project folder.

---

### Selected thread loads do not refetch provider models

#### Feature/Change Name
Message loads for an already selected thread do not trigger redundant model preference or provider-model requests.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Use a thread that already has a captured provider and visible messages.
2. Start local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
3. Keep browser developer tools or the profiling report available for request inspection.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/thread/<thread-id>`.
2. Reload the route or navigate away and back to force a message load.
3. Confirm the conversation messages render and the model dropdown remains scoped to that thread's provider.
4. Run `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_ROUTE='#/thread/<thread-id>' PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 pnpm run profile:browser`.
5. Inspect the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-*.json`.
6. Repeat the route reload in dark theme and confirm the same model dropdown and messages remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- Loading messages does not call the model config or provider-model endpoints again after the thread/provider state is already loaded.
- The profile shows no duplicate provider model/config requests caused by `loadMessages`.
- The model dropdown still shows only the selected thread provider's models.
- Light and dark theme conversation and model dropdown surfaces remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.

---

### Startup profiler request dedupe

#### Feature/Change Name
Startup thread-list and skills-list refreshes reuse fresh in-memory results, and the profiler distinguishes pinned-thread summary hydration from duplicate full thread reads.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Start local Vite: `pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
2. Ensure the browser profiler is available from this repository.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, run `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 pnpm run profile:browser`.
2. Open the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-home-*.json`.
3. Confirm `duplicateCounts.threadListFirstPage` is `1`, `duplicateCounts.skillsList` is `1`, and `warnings` is empty.
4. Run `PROFILE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 PROFILE_WAIT_MS=7000 pnpm run profile:thread`.
5. Open the generated `output/playwright/browser-runtime-profile-thread-*.json`.
6. Confirm `duplicateCounts.threadReadWithTurns` is `0` or `1`, `duplicateCounts.threadReadDuplicateKeys` is `0`, and `warnings` is empty.
7. Repeat the home route in dark theme and confirm the page finishes loading without `pageState.stillLoadingThreads`.

#### Expected Results
- Startup event bursts do not issue duplicate first-page `thread/list` requests.
- Startup event bursts do not issue duplicate same-cwd `skills/list` requests.
- Pinned-thread summaries may appear as `thread/read:*:summary` rows, but they do not trigger duplicate full-read warnings.
- Light and dark themes both complete thread loading.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.

---

### Codex app-server memories default and opt-out

#### Feature/Change Name
Packaged CLI starts Codex app-server with memories enabled by default and supports `--no-memories`.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Build the CLI: `pnpm run build:cli`.
2. Use a temporary Codex home that does not already enable memories, for example `CODEX_HOME=$(mktemp -d)`.

#### Steps
1. Run the unit test: `pnpm exec vitest run src/server/appServerRuntimeConfig.test.ts`.
2. Start the packaged CLI in light theme with the temporary Codex home: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> node dist-cli/index.js --no-open --no-tunnel --no-login --no-password --port 5900`.
3. Trigger any route or action that starts the underlying Codex app-server.
4. Confirm the spawned app-server command includes `-c features.memories=true`, or confirm `codex features list` with equivalent config reports `memories` enabled.
5. Stop the temporary CLI process.
6. Start the packaged CLI with opt-out: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> node dist-cli/index.js --no-open --no-tunnel --no-login --no-password --no-memories --port 5900`.
7. Trigger any route or action that starts the underlying Codex app-server.
8. Confirm the spawned app-server command includes `-c features.memories=false`.
9. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5900/#/` and confirm the app shell still renders normally in light theme.
10. Switch to dark theme and confirm the app shell still renders normally.

#### Expected Results
- `buildAppServerArgs()` includes `-c features.memories=true`.
- `CODEXUI_MEMORIES=false` and `--no-memories` produce `-c features.memories=false`.
- The packaged CLI no longer depends on the user's `~/.codex/config.toml` to enable memories for its spawned app-server.
- Light and dark themes are unchanged because this is a runtime launch/config change, not a UI surface change.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary packaged CLI process.
- Remove the temporary `CODEX_HOME`.

---

### Provider-backed scheduled refreshes keep model menus populated

#### Feature/Change Name
Background ancillary refreshes preserve provider-specific models for selected Zen/OpenRouter threads.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Use an isolated `CODEX_HOME` with an existing Zen or OpenRouter thread.
2. Copy Codex auth into that same `CODEX_HOME` so the global provider becomes Codex.
3. Start local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open the old provider-backed thread.
2. Wait for the background refresh after route load.
3. Open the model dropdown.
4. Confirm the dropdown is populated with that thread provider's models, not empty and not Codex/GPT models.
5. Hover or focus an assistant response and confirm copy/fork actions are visibly readable.
6. Repeat in dark theme and confirm the same provider-scoped model menu and response actions remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- Scheduled refreshes fetch provider models for provider-backed selected threads even when they are not doing an explicit provider-change refresh.
- The model dropdown never falls back to disabled `Model` or an empty list for a loaded provider-backed thread.
- Assistant copy/fork actions have readable contrast in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.
- Remove the temporary isolated `CODEX_HOME` if it is no longer needed.

---

### Projectless new chat folder collisions

#### Feature/Change Name
Projectless new chats continue to create folders after repeated identical first messages.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Use an isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
2. Start local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
3. Ensure `~/Documents/Codex/<today>/` already contains many folders for the same prompt slug, for example `hi`, `hi-2`, through `hi-100`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`.
2. Start a projectless new chat with the message `hi`.
3. Confirm the app creates a new folder under `~/Documents/Codex/<today>/` and opens the new thread without showing `Unable to create a unique new chat folder`.
4. Confirm the created folder keeps the prompt slug and includes a unique timestamp/random suffix after the readable collision range is exhausted.
5. Repeat in dark theme and confirm the new thread opens with readable composer and conversation surfaces.

#### Expected Results
- New projectless chats do not fail after common prompts exhaust the readable sequential suffix range.
- The app preserves readable folder names for early collisions and switches to unique suffixes for later collisions.
- Light and dark theme new-chat and conversation surfaces remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.
- Remove any temporary collision folders created under `~/Documents/Codex/<today>/` if they are no longer needed.

### New chat live thinking and stop controls

#### Feature/Change Name
Projectless new chats show live thinking state and interrupt controls while a turn is active.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Use an isolated `CODEX_HOME` with valid Codex auth.
2. Start local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`.
2. In the projectless `Chats` composer, send `create todo list app`.
3. Within a few seconds after send, confirm the conversation shows a live `Thinking` overlay even if no detailed activity event has arrived yet.
4. Confirm the composer shows a stop button while the turn is active.
5. Wait for the assistant output and confirm the stop button is replaced by the normal send button after completion.
6. Repeat in dark theme and confirm the live overlay and stop button remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- Active thread status from `thread/read`, including `{ status: { type: "active" } }`, keeps the selected thread marked in progress.
- The live overlay renders default `Thinking` for any active selected thread, even before reasoning/activity text arrives.
- The stop button is visible while the turn is active and disappears after completion.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.
- Remove temporary projectless chat folders under `~/Documents/Codex/<today>/` if they are no longer needed.

### Qodo provider/auth review fixes

#### Feature/Change Name
OpenRouter community-key classification and stalled thread-resume recovery.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Use an isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
2. Start local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=<temp-home> pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
3. Prepare one no-auth session that uses the default OpenRouter community/free-mode state and one session with valid Codex auth copied into the same home.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, switch to OpenRouter without entering a user API key.
2. Confirm the saved free-mode state remains community-backed, then copy Codex auth into the same `CODEX_HOME` and restart.
3. Confirm Codex auth suppresses the community OpenRouter fallback instead of treating it as a custom key.
4. Open an existing thread and simulate or observe a stalled `thread/resume`; after the resume coalescing TTL, retry the thread open.
5. Confirm the retry starts a fresh resume request instead of staying pinned behind the original stalled request.
6. Repeat the visible provider switch and thread-open checks in dark theme and confirm errors, composer controls, and model labels remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- Blank OpenRouter provider saves do not turn remembered community keys into `customKey: true`.
- Explicit user OpenRouter keys and previously custom OpenRouter state remain custom.
- A never-settling `resumeThread()` request cannot permanently block future resume attempts for the same thread.
- Light and dark themes both show readable provider, model, and error/retry surfaces.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.
- Remove the isolated `CODEX_HOME` after verification.

### Qodo free-mode state write fixes

#### Feature/Change Name
Free-mode provider settings create missing `CODEX_HOME` before writing state.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Choose a fresh path that does not exist yet, for example `/tmp/codex-missing-home-test`.
2. Start local Vite: `CODEX_HOME=/tmp/codex-missing-home-test pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/`.
2. Open Settings and switch Provider to OpenRouter or another free-mode provider setting that writes `webui-custom-providers.json`.
3. Confirm the provider update succeeds and `/tmp/codex-missing-home-test/webui-custom-providers.json` is created.
4. Confirm the state file has restrictive owner-only permissions.
5. Repeat the provider switch in dark theme and confirm the settings controls and any errors remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- Free-mode provider writes do not fail with `ENOENT` when `CODEX_HOME` is missing at startup.
- The state file parent directory is created automatically before writes.
- The state file is written with restrictive permissions.
- Light and dark theme provider settings remain readable.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.
- Remove `/tmp/codex-missing-home-test` after verification.

### Automation panel dark action row specificity fix

#### Feature/Change Name
Automation rename action row dark-theme override is scoped with the component base rule.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Start local Vite: `pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
2. Use an account or fixture state with at least one automation-backed thread.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/#/` and open the automation thread rename panel.
2. Confirm the sticky action row uses a white background and light border.
3. Switch to dark theme and reopen the same panel.
4. Confirm the sticky action row uses a dark zinc background and dark border, with readable buttons and no light strip at the bottom.

#### Expected Results
- The base light action row remains unchanged in light theme.
- In dark theme, the action row reliably uses dark styling from the scoped component rule regardless of global stylesheet injection order.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.

### Bold URL trailing punctuation parsing

#### Feature/Change Name
Bold-wrapped plain URLs followed by punctuation render as clean links.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Start local Vite: `pnpm run dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`.
2. Open the `TestChat` project and use an existing thread or create a new one.

#### Steps
1. In light theme, send a message containing `**https://example.com**.`.
2. Inspect the rendered message row.
3. Confirm the URL text is rendered as a link with `href` and `title` equal to `https://example.com`.
4. Confirm the final period remains visible as plain text after the link.
5. Repeat in dark theme and confirm the link and punctuation remain readable.

#### Expected Results
- The bold asterisk wrapper is removed from the rendered URL.
- Trailing punctuation is not included in the link target.
- Light and dark themes both render the link and punctuation clearly.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Stop the temporary Vite server if it was only used for this check.
