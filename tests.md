# Tests

This file is the manual test index. Detailed regression and feature verification steps live in domain folders under [`tests/`](tests/).

## Architecture

- Keep one root index (`tests.md`) so existing links and contributor habits keep working.
- Put each product area in a domain folder such as `tests/automations/` or `tests/chat-composer-rendering/`.
- Keep one manual test section per file inside the domain folder so feature updates create small diffs and narrow merge conflicts.
- Use each domain folder `index.md` to find the detailed section file.
- Add new test sections to the narrowest matching domain folder; create a new domain folder only when no existing domain fits.
- Use [`tests/template.md`](tests/template.md) for the required manual test shape.
